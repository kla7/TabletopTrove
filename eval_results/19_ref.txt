Life can be difficult, even brutal, as you deal with fearful and violent humans, treacherous and manipulative trolls, and all manner of strange creatures and harsh environments.  It is time to embark on an epic journey of discovery to seek and find long-hidden answers about your mythical elfin ancestors, the High Ones. Each player selects a character, gathers up their attending items, skills and allies and joins their tribe-mates to complete tasks, events and quests.  There are a limited number of seasons during which you need to complete each scenario card. If you fail to do so, every member of your tribe loses resources (cards, tokens and cubes). If ever a character runs out of cubes, they are killed and removed from the game.  Each scenario in ElfQuest Adventure Game pulls directly from 35+ years of Richard & Wendy Pini's epic saga of comics and graphic novels. Sometimes your tribe will have to fight humans, negotiate with new elf tribes, travel across snow-laden mountains, mate to increase your tribe's numbers, hunt and harvest to keep everyone fed or craft new items to help in your journey.  This cooperative game for 1-4 players delivers all the wonder, passion, danger, compassion and betrayal of the original best-selling series. It features the breathtaking artwork of Wendy Pini interwoven with the imaginative game design of Layman Kingsford. You will stretch your gaming and social skills as you interact with the extraordinary realm of Elfquest as you've never seen it before!
