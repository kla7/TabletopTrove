Recommended Game: Dungeon Dice

Dungeon Dice is a competitive, all-dice game with a classic adventuring feel in which players battle monsters and try to collect more dice than their friends. Players equip dice, drink dice potions, and kill dice monsters. If you've killed enough monsters, grab a level-up die. You get the idea. In the game, players take turns drawing monster dice from a bag. To defeat a monster, players roll their dice and compare them to the monster's dice. The totals change as players use abilities and attempt to aid or sabotage one another. With each victory, players earn more dice from bags full of potions, weapons, and magical artifacts. Players race to collect enough impressive dice to gain a claim on the throne, thereby winning the game.
