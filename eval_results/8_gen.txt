I recommend Tek-No-Krazy. This game is a vintage 1950s game made by Reilly and Lee Co. It's a small box game that includes 36 metal pegs, playing board, and directions. Players take turns trying to guess which player wrote which quip for bizarre pictures, unusual film clips, and other on-screen oddities. The more right guesses players make, the more points they score and the more points they score, the better. Be spontaneous, be unpredictable, be edgy-it doesn't matter, so long as you Quip It! good. This game is a great option for casual players looking for a fun and quick game to play with friends or family. It's a good ice breaker and can be played in a short amount of time, making it perfect for parties or game nights.
