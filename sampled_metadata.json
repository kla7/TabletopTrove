The game employs the popular card-driven mechanics of such well-known games as Twilight Struggle and 1960: The Making of the President. Representing the Federalists and Anti-Federalists, the players pursue strategies to ratify or defeat the Constitution.  The Federalists win if nine states ratifiy the Constitution.  The Anti-Federalists win if five states refuse to ratify.  The game places a premium on hand management and strategic planning by providing players with the tools to build powerful hands of cards over consecutive turns.  After players become familiar with the deck of cards, playing time should be around 2 hours.",

As a player shouts out a word, that player snags the cube with that letter on it. Opponents must object immediately if they think the word just shouted does not relate to the category.  When all of the letter cubes have been snagged, or players have gone 10 seconds or more without coming up with a word, the round is over. Players score one point for each letter cube they snagged during the round. The first player to snag 20 points wins.  The rules include some variants.

All the various campaigns (Spain, Portugal, Prussia, Austria, etc) were not considered separate and isolated from one another, as they were in reality. The necessity to count battles on two, three, or four fronts as all being connected is dictated by several historical assumptions: the numbers of enemies to face, the blocking off of England, which was likely to become a way to isolate France on the continent, and the British tenacity in arousing national anti-French sentiments. Napoleon's goal is to conquer all of Europe, without which the financial possibilities of the English would render impossible the existence of the empire. The play of alliances, created according to the political and military mechanisms which are always unstable, is an instrument equally valid foe either player to use in order to obtain a victory which only the forces of the two individual countries could not obtain, even in theory.",

    "description":"Subtitle of the game: \"Reformation and Counter-Reformation, 1532-1555\"  On the box cover: \"The time is 6 February 1531.\"  One of the games in SPI's Power Politics series.  From the publisher:  Recreating the turbulent era of the Reformation, from the viewpoint of political\/religious interaction and military activity. A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.  A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.  The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.  The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.  A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.  Other notes:  Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.

    "description":"You play a Lord of a Season, bringing seasonal changes to the world. As time goes by, one season replaces another in seasonal order; Spring is followed by Summer, Summer by Fall and Fall by Winter. However, you want to turn the time your way to have your season dominating the world.  When all your season tiles have been played to the game board or you have a majority of season tiles in one area, your season dominates the world.  The players take turn to play season tiles to one of six hexagonal areas, each of which has six season slots. The six season slots are arranged in a circle where each slot is adjacent to two other slots. The six areas are also arranged in a circle where each area is adjacent to two other areas.  Within an area, season tiles must be placed in seasonal order. Between areas, season tiles must be similar. If they are not, the later season will replace the earlier (e.g. Spring will replace Winter).  Besides placing season tiles, a player may turn one area clockwise so that new seasons end up adjacent to each other, resulting in one replacing the other. To really twist the time, a player may turn all areas counter-clockwise, resulting in several seasons replacing each other. However, since this turn is twisted, earlier seasons will replace later (e.g. Winter will replace Spring).  Once a season is banished from an area, it may not easily return, so the players will gradually increase their local dominance until a global winner emerges. To win Turn of Time, you must find the turns that brings most of your seasons to the board while blocking your opponents' opportunities to replace your seasons.  The unique mechanism of Turn of Time is the so called circular relation between the players where A is stronger than B, B is stronger than C etc. This mechanism, in combination with the revolving game areas, opens up in-numerous strategical paths. Should you accept being banished from one area to expand in another? Should you place your seasons so that they can attack easily or so that they are difficult to attack? Will the benefits of turning one or several areas outweigh the benefits other players may receive? Will you even be able to foresee all turns in the game if all areas are turned? You must find the answer yourself!",

A stone's throw away, on the other side of the Niagara River, is Upper Canada. Here rights and privileges are determined by familial and social connections. The province is controlled by a small clique of Tories who govern the province as though it were a family business.  Opposing these ruling elites are the Reformers - men who espouse dangerous, American ideas: Justice, liberty, and equality.  In this game of the Upper Canada Rebellion, players assume the role of Tory or Reformer. Using an impulse system and point-to-movement, players move their leaders throughout the province rallying supporters, and react to historical events.  The Reformer, through legislation, petition, and rebellion must cause enough trouble in the province that Her Majesty's Government takes notice.  But be careful! Cause too much trouble and your rag-tag rebels could find themselves squaring-off against regiments of British regulars.  The Tory, through control of the churches, and intimidation, must retain the status quo. Don't be too harsh, however, lest Her Majesty's Government get wind of your corruptions.",

The three maps cover the area from the far north of Denmark, through Germany and Austria to the industrial heartland of Italy.  The standard rules constitute the fast game, and contain all the rules necessary to play \"The Next War\" land game - a complete game that can be played independently. The most notable mechanic is the combination of combat within the movement of land units, with the ability of units to greatly exceed the basic movement allowance at increased risk of fatigue\/attrition.  Optional rules cover weather, supply, chemical\/nuclear warfare, air and naval operations, airborne\/airmobile and amphibious operations, helicopters and special forces, and electronic warfare and add can considerably to the record keeping and playing time.  The campaign game covers the first 60 days after mobilization in three basic scenarios, Sudden War, Spring Maneuvers, Tension. The differences between these three concern the timing of the outbreak of war and the resultant state of readiness of the respective forces. Due to the large number of optional rules, however, the players may in fact choose from a vast array of possible Campaign Game situations.  Six smaller scenarios depict smaller areas of operations over briefer periods of time in the regions of Berlin, Vienna, The Baltic, Fulda, North German Plains, and the Main Front (Fulda + North German Plains).  The game components: three 22\" x 35\" map sheets plus one 6\" x 8\" and one 10\" x 12\" map extensions, 2400 die-cut 1\/2\" counters, one 32 page rules book, one 40 page Scenarios and Situation Briefing book, two identical 4 page Charts & Tables folders, and one 17\" x 22\" Air Allocation Display.",

There are scenarios covering the 1805 campaign against Austria, the 1806 campaign against Prussia and the 1809 campaign against Austria (again). The Russians appear in the 1805 and 1806 campaigns, with possible Prussian entry against the French in the 1805 scenario. The game includes a 22” x 28” map, a 400 counter sheet (although there are a number of blank counters) as well the rules (accordion format), and separate sheets for the scenarios and tables. The game system is based on that of the earlier Leipzig game, also by SPI. La Grande Armee has a bit more variety, as three distinct separate campaigns are covered. The composition of the various national armies also varies. The composition of the Austrian army in the 1809 scenario is quite different from that of the Austrian army in the 1805 scenario. This reflects various reforms carried out by the Austrians in the interim between the campaigns. The emphasis of the game is on maneuver, including forced marches, and supply. Dispersion for movement and concentration for combat is a key tactic. The French have a significant advantage in forced marching, as well as in the quality of their leaders. Note this game is totally different from the later TSR ‘remake’ of the same title.",

In the Adventure Time episode \"Card Wars\", Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.  Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.  Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!  In Adventure Time Card Wars: Lemongrab vs. Gunter, The Earl of Lemongrab and his sour disposition take on the cool as a cucumber penguin, Gunter! Lemongrab's deck contains cards that utilize SandyLands and Cornfield Landscapes. His new strategies include giving his opponent bad Creatures that take up space and mess up his opponent's combat phase. Keeping your opponents Creatures alive might just be your key to victory! You will also find new \"bounce\" Creatures that can enter and leave play at a moment's notice. And this deck can mess with your opponent's Landscapes!  Gunter’s deck utilizes IcyLands and Blue Plains Landscapes. As a penguin, Gunter likes to hang out on the ice. Now he can! His deck has brand new ways of putting Frozen tokens on Landscapes...and this time, he might want to freeze his own! When his Creatures occupy Frozen Landscapes, they will be much more powerful. Of course, if he wants to get rid of the tokens he will need a lot of cards in hand. Blue Plains is still the king of card draw. Blue Plains is also the best at moving Creatures between Landscapes. You will find that ability very useful with Frozen tokens hanging around! You will also find some very powerful Blue Plains Creatures that must move each turn, or suffer the consequences.  Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!",

The questions are about science, biology, physics and common knowledge, but there are also riddles. If you get the answer right you get pieces of paper that look like money, but they actually represent different amount of brain cells.  When you have enough brain cells you get to enter the paths that go into the middle of the board. On those paths you continue to get questions, but you also get to do challenges. The challenges are things you do with your body, for example you could get a card that says you have 30 seconds to try and wiggle your ears using only the muscles in your head. When you successfully do a challenge you get a star.  When you have gathered 3 stars you are allowed to try and reach the very center of the board. The first one to get there (with the right amount of brain cells AND stars) wins the game.  As a reward the winner of the game gets to perform an experiment from the experiment folder.

Moons (in the More Cosmic Encounter expansion) have text written on them (instead of only a number which you used to refer to a separate list).  Moons also were divided into four categories:  Full Moons have a major effect on the game; Half Moons are more moderate in their effects; Quarter Moons have a minor effect; Cheese Moons introduce silliness to the game.      Lucre (in the More Cosmic Encounter expansion) was revamped with additional uses, and players were required to spend it to affect their challenge totals.

Do you rely on sheer fishing talent, or do you break out the Banjooki 2000 Platinum-plated Turbo Reel to haul in the monster fish? The choice is yours!  Take the Bait plays up to four players, and features a game board laid out like a lake with the game sections arranged around the lake in a semi-circle. The players take on the roles of four fishing teams at a tournament, lead by some whimsical characters with special abilities from which the players can choose.  The game is divided into three days (rounds), with three turns each round. Players begin the first, third and sixth turns at camp, in tents. They visit the campground canteen and, depending on certain circumstances, choose a coffee for the day, which will determine their turn order. Of course, the coffee that gives the biggest kick allows a player to go first but it also costs the most. Then it's onto the tackle shop to buy some equipment - some items are mundane, but cheap, while others are a bit more special but may require players to spend more cash, which isn't easy to come by.  Next, it's time for fishing. According to certain character powers, equipment mixes, etc. the players take turns drawing fish (tiles) out of three areas of the lake. The area closest to shore is the easiest to fish in, but it's where all the smaller fish dwell. The middle body of the lake has some bigger fish but requires a pier license to reach. The third is the deepest and most costly in which to fish, but it's where the big daddies live, including one monster catfish that has never been caught and has fueled tall tales for years at the lake. Mixed into the tiles in each of the sections are also various bits of detritus such as old boots, lost bikinis and such that always seem to latch onto hooks during any fishing trip. They'll hurt your score at the end of the tournament, but some may very well be of use to someone if they, or an opponent, have a matching item...  Then there's the market, where fish can be sold for money to buy bigger equipment, or held until the end of the current day (round). The market prices fluctuate from day to day and there's a catch of the day that brings a bonus, so players will have to decide whether that fish is best kept for score or sold for cash.  The final station for each turn is the lodge where teams can hire a guide - an extra hand that will help them fish for the day. The guides get cheaper as the tournament draws to an end, so players will need to decide whether they pay a premium for that extra help in the beginning or save their money for one last push at the end. Teams can also check the weather for the next day while at the lodge, giving them a little insight at the weather patterns that could influence fish migration.  The next turns continue until the end of the day when there is a weigh in, which scores points for players. The player who has the most points at the end of three days wins!  Teams can also freely trade among themselves. This trading keeps the game lively and social, as players tempt each other to \"take the bait.\"",

Roley. The two-and-a-half-hour performance will begin at 3:00 p.m., Saturday, August 15, and is expected to fill the Roley City Municipal Auditorium. \"Rock has fond memories of Roley High,\" said the star's business manager, Joseph K. Awledge, \"and he's looking forward to seeing many of his old friends again.\" While the Class of '54 has much to celebrate, it will not eagerly recall the outcome of the 1954 Homecoming game. The Big Game with rival Lowe Valley was lost by the Roley Rollers 24 - 21, the first ever loss to the Lowe Riders. Homecoming was also marred by the tragic death of Becky Sue Lamour, a student at Roley High who was killed near midnight after the Homecoming dance, when the car in which she was a passenger stalled on the railroad tracks at Back Road Crossing and was struck by a freight train. The driver, Rock N. Roley, escaped without injury. Reunion activities will commence at 9:00 a.m. Saturday with a tour of the new gymnasium, after which Principal R.

You can have up to five rows by nine columns. This creates a reserves system. That creates a bluff mechanic.

Each player must move his 4 pieces (thims) up the board by rolling the dice or piggy-backing on the thim of another player.  The goal of the game is to have each of your thims on the last four squares of the board.  The player can use the blue arrows to advance up the board if he lands on one and if he lands on a square with a red arrow must slide to the bottom of the arrow.  There are some special squares that force the player to roll a six to move past that square and some that allow the player to roll the dice again.  The most interesting square on the board is the STYMIE square.  If a person gets his thim to land on the STYMIE square no other player may move their thims past him until he moves his thim.  This makes for a burst for the finish ending in many games.  Players may move any of their thims on their turn including ones that may be buried in a stack of other thims as long as they take all thims resting on top of theirs.  This rule does not apply on the top row where only the top thim may move.  This is a fairly simple game and probably appeals mostly to children.

    "description":"Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.  What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.  Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is ±1 point, the second card is ±2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!  A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.  Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.",

    "description":"Dark Shadows was the first of two board games based on the TV series to come out onto the market in the late 1960s. Each player is dealt 4 cards of varying types. Players use these cards to drive their movement across the board by matching a card to a particular space. Each turn, a player either plays the appropriate card to move ahead or discards one and stays put, then draws a new card. The first player to reach the end space is the winner.  Some strategy is added by the nature of the board spaces. Certain paths will call for any card that matches a number value (1 or 2) or color (red or black). Others require a specific symbol (bat, spider, poison cup, or knife), or one of the special vampire cards (Barnabas or the generic Vampire). There are alternate paths a player may choose which are shorter, but require more specific items.  Re-implemented by:      Creature Castle     Black Hole: Space Alert Game",

In the game, players have three rolls to catch a fish by rolling a HEAD and a TAIL (worth 10 points together), and various sized BODIES that add to the score of the fish.  The BONUS die adds its value to each fish caught.  Players have to choose which dice to keep and which dice to re-roll on their second and third rolls.  One side of the dice contains a small PANFISH, which is worth only one point, and cannot be re-rolled. However, if a player manages to roll 5 PANFISH, the player proclaims a FISHFRY!, and the other players have to \"FRY-UP\" their fish. Players often have the choice to push their luck, and try for larger fish.  In a single round game the goal is to catch and score the single largest fish possible, in a tournament players record their score and try for the largest grand total.  The game is light, quick, and easy to learn. Included are rules for one-round games, as well as multiple round fishing tournaments.  The dice are custom engraved in the USA by Chessex.",

    "description":"In Cultists of Cthulhu, you play as a student or professor at Miskatonic University, working with your friends to investigate the horrors invading your school. Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.  The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.  The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.  The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.  Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.  Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called \"possibly the next Arkham Horror.\"",

This game uses a deck of 44 cards, which consists of three suits (Green, Yellow, Red), and 14 ranks (1-14), plus Green 0 (Dog) and Red 15 (Old Man). Cards ranked 1-3 (with a child figure on the card), ranked 12-14 (ghost figure on the card), Dog, and Old Man are honor cards. You score points by taking these cards.  Each round, players play a card under trick-taking rules (must follow suit, no trumps). Basically, the player who played the highest rank, regardless of which suit, wins the trick. But there are several exceptions. One example is that if you and other player play a child of the same suit, both of you take that child card and score one point, instead of being taken by the winner of the trick.  In a four-player game, you win the game with your partner if your team takes honor cards more than your opponent team.  In a three-player game, the player who played Old Man (Red 15) competes against the other two. The Old Man wins if he captures three children of different rank or he takes 11 honor cards. Otherwise the other two players win the game.

There are many powerful groups in The City, like the Church, Ninjas, and the Post-Apocalyptic Beasts.  HappyCOM-9 has announced that there will be an election and that any group that wants to nominate a candidate to run against it may do so.  You are one of those candidates.  Your goal is to increase your power, influence, and intelligence so you are strong enough, popular enough, and smart enough to beat HappyCOM-9 in an election.  During your campaign for President, you'll buy fantastic items (rocket-powered roller skates, flamethrowers, etc.) from the Catalog and compete in Game Shows (minigames within the game, like You Bet Your Clone!).",

Displaced civilizations from throughout time and imagination battle each other. Armies that have stepped from the pages of history face armies that could never have existed. This is the Way, an endless Road that the lost are drawn to, whether it is lost to history, to accident, or to imagination.  The Way of War is a universal miniatures system that allows players to control the kind of game they play. It allows everything from Napoleonic formations to wizards casting spells to vehicles running a muck to artillery of a most unusual nature.  The Way of War allows you to bring any model you want into the game, whether historical, fantasy, or just plain weird. The Way of War can incorporate any model, no matter how fantastic or with what special abilities, into the game.  Twenty armies are included, all new and different from what you've seen before.  The Way itself is a world in which any kind of battle that is possible to the imagination can be fought.  This is The Way of War. A miniatures game that allows you to do anything you can conceive.  This is merely a rulebook. You'll also need 10-sided dice, a ruler, and miniatures to play. Some useful templates are included on the last page of this book.",

As the crowd watches the very entertaining spectacle of people trying to feel a shape without looking in, pulling the bag back and forth, and trying not to pull out the wrong shape, or a black shape, or to grab the camel piece and slam it down shouting \"I'm the camel!\", they get to decide if players have cheated or failed the task. It's a very aggressive but fun game. First player to seven pieces win.  The rules are suprisingly complex though, with several What If variants that you have to run through to understand all the possible outcomes. The other three games in the rules offer variants on what to do with the pieces, such as build a tower, but it's essentially still a duel. Along with Bausack and Bamboleo, Zoch seem to have cornered the market in oddly shaped wooden pieces. Dscahamal is nicely made and fun, but you may tire of it quickly, both physically and mentally.",

To capture a tank, move your tank into the space it occupies.  Each space on the board features one of four types of terrain, either dirt, grass, hill, or mud. Each space gives you a different combination of attack and movement range when you move from that space. You can get stuck in the mud with a movement of zero, or blast down a hill with a movement of 2! Your attack range is consistently 1, except for when you have the high vantage point of the hill space.  This has the feel of a classic strategy game like Othello or Stratego.

    "name":"Keyper",
    "description":"Keyper is a game with high player interaction for two to four players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn and finally winter.  Each player starts the game with their own village board, a mini keyp board, 12 village tiles, a keyper (waving meeple) in their player color, and a team of eight multi-colored keyples, including two white keyples. Each differently colored keyple is a specialist in one activity: the brown keyper is a woodsman, the black keyple is a miner, the orange keyple a clay worker, etc. The white keyples are generalists who can represent any other color.  Keyper is a worker placement game. (Keyper is the eighth new title in the medieval Key series of games, with Keydom, the second in the series being widely recognized as the first of the worker placement genre of games.) What makes Keyper special is that when one player places a keyple on a country board, another player can join them with a matching colored keyple on the first player's turn to the benefit of both players. In this way some players are likely to have played all their keyples before others. All keyples have the potential to work twice. If a player has played all of their keyples, but another player still has some, then on their turn the player with no remaining keyples can lay down one or more keyples on the country board they have claimed or in their village board to secure additional resources or actions. It can therefore be doubly beneficial to co-operate with your fellow players, although Keyper is not a co-operative game in the usual sense of the term.  The country boards are also noteworthy in that they can be manipulated and folded at the beginning of summer, autumn and winter to show one of four different permutations of fields for that season. A player will chose the one to suit their strategy, often hoping that another player will complement their choice. Certain fields on the country boards are available only in certain seasons, e.g., raw materials can be upgraded to finished goods only in spring and summer after which you can only convert using tiles in your own village. Gem mining occurs only in autumn and winter.  A player's strategy is likely to be influenced by which (seeded) spring country tiles they acquire and by the particular colored keyples they have available in the later seasons. Different combinations will encourage a player to develop their farm or village, help with their shipping or mining activities, and prepare for the seasonal fairs. Players constantly need to evaluate whether or not to join other players, when to claim a country board, whether to play on their own or another player's country board, when to use their own village, and whether to create a large or small team of keyples for the following season. The winner is the player to gain the most points, usually through pursuing at least a couple of the different strategies.  In addition to the theme and mechanisms, Keyper has similar traits to the earlier Key games: Game actions are positive and constructive, not destructive; player interaction is through the game mechanisms not direct, and like Keyflower, the previous game in the series, there is a lot of player interaction.  A special English-language Kickstarter edition of Keyper with \"character\" keyples and keypers will also be released.",

The giant and his bodyguards have been living in this same little mine shaft for over 300 years. Now as you can imagine the mine is really disgusting, there are germs everywhere, and not only germs but super germs. These super germs can cause diarrhea in house elves.

They begin to waddle and walk around in circles mumbling to themselves. If these trolls had a brain they would be really dangerous.\"  \"Another interesting aspect of trolls is that when they see an elf they drool, and when I say drool I really mean drool. Because of this it is really difficult for an elf to sneak around because they are tracking mucus around on the bottoms of their boots, not to mention it is really slippery. On the positive side when a troll captures a house elf and drools all over it, it can become very slippery and sometimes it can squirm and slip free.\"  \"Two other techniques house elves have learned that are effective against trolls. First, trolls can't stand elves that squeak and second, trolls are particularly self conscious when elves flash them.\"",

The war began in 218 BC, with the Carthaginians led by Hannibal, one of history’s greatest commanders. The two nations clashed for over a decade, with each experiencing triumphs and defeats. Following the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC, a ceasefire was negotiated. It was broken following a Carthaginian attack on a stranded Roman fleet in the Gulf of Tunis. Determined to finally win the war, Roman General Scipio Africanus led an invasion force into North Africa, the Carthaginian homeland. The opposing armies met near the town of Zama. Despite being outnumbered, the Romans were able to defeat the Carthaginians. With that victory the Romans had effectively won the war.  Zama is part of DG’s Battles of the Ancient World series, that emphasizes simple but realistic design features to show critical aspects of classical era combat. Special rules for leadership, missile fire, and elephants are included.",

One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get his team to say the word or phrase on the screen. When he or she is successful, he or she hands the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!  The primary differences of this game from its progenitor is the implementation of the electronic device, timer, and substantial word lists. The electronic edition has also spawned several spin-offs and sequels. As of 2013, \"Electronic\" was dropped from the name, leaving it as simply Catch Phrase, effectively replacing the original.

After you complete the challenge on your turn, move to the next square that matches the color on your card.  If you draw a green card, immediately move forward or backward on the game path to the green square with the matching picture.  3. Play continues to the left until someone reaches the striped square at BOZ's treehouse and wins.",

    "description":"In medieval Baghdad, a boy named Afumed was working for a general shop. There were many pots containing many kinds of items. His boss gave orders to sort the pots, but Afumed lost the tags on them. Before the boss comes back, he must sort all the pots.  In The Arabian Pots, you try to sort the pots by listening to the sounds they make when you shake them. The game includes three groups of three pots, with each group making a different sound when you shake it, as well as one pot that makes no sound.  For the basic game, your goal is to create a row of three pots that make the same sound. To set up, set aside the quiet pot, then place the other nine pots at random in the 3x3 grid of the game board. While all other players look away from the board, the first player swaps pairs of pots three times, not shaking them in the process. All of the other players make three swaps in a similar manner, then the game begins. On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:       Shake one of the pots.     Swap two pots in the same horizontal or vertical line, without shaking them in the process.   If that player thinks a row contains pots that all have the same sound, yell \"Complete!\", then shake the three pots to see whether the guess is correct. If so, the player wins; if not, that player loses their next turn and the game continues.  To use the quiet pot, during set up the first player replaces one of the regular pots with the quiet pot (without shaking anything), then does the pot swaps as usual. If someone shakes the quiet pot during the game, that player must then swap that pot with an adjacent pot while everyone else looks away from the board.  To play The Arabian Pots with people who are blind, announce which pots (1-9) you are shaking or moving. The notch in the game board indicates the bottom of the board.  As an alternate set-up, place the nine noisy pots on the board and the quiet pot to the side. Players then remove one pot at a time from the board, shaking them or not as desired, then place the pots in front of themselves. Place the quiet pot on #5, then take turns placing the pots on the board, leaving the final pot aside unshaken. Then play the game as normal except that whoever shakes the quiet pot must swap it with an adjacent pot (while others turn their back) and miss their next turn.",

The game is won by a player when his opponent loses all their pieces, cannot make a legal move, or resigns; a draw can be arrived at by mutual agreement or after making a predetermined number of moves per side without a capture.  Pieces capture other pieces by jumping over them.  However, a piece cannot capture another piece above its rank.  The game is related to the Alquerque family but uses a larger and differently-arranged board.",

Victory Points (VP) are awarded for building structures during the game as well as at the end. In each game, two special scoring cards are drawn from a deck that allow players to gain bonus points by meeting certain conditions.  In the building rounds, the players summon their specialized characters onto the game board and employ them (using Action Points) to construct valuable structures such as Walls, Houses, Battlements, Towers, Palaces, Fountains, and Pastures. These are built from their supplies of colored building blocks. In addition to expanding their own kingdoms, the players can use their forces to hinder the progress of their rivals.  In the crowning round, the players display their completed kingdoms and flaunt their power over the realm. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner!  Character Classes:  Kings summon the other characters to the board from the supply. Villagers are needed to build Houses (which can be converted into Towers and Palaces). Artisans are necessary to complete the building of advanced structures. Horses assist the other characters in their movements on the board. Thieves can climb on Walls, and can steal Action Points from their rivals. Knights can attack opponents' characters.  Warlocks can use their Mana to cast spells (which are different in each game).",

    "description":"In June 1942, forces of the Japanese Northern Army occupied Attu Island as part of its Midway campaign. Attu, at the far western end of the Aleutian Archipelago, was American soil. In May 1943, American forces landed on Attu to liberate it. They were unprepared for the tenacity of the Japanese defenders and the brutality of the environmental conditions. What was expected to be a week-long clean-up exercise became a month-long, nose-to-nose meat-grinder whose casualty levels would not be exceeded until Iwo Jima.  War in the Wind is a low-to-moderate complexity game (roughly eight pages of rules) depicting the brutal combat and conditions on Attu. The design focuses on the challenges faced by the American forces in the form of extremely variable weather conditions and logistical hurdles posed by nearly insurmountable terrain. The Japanese must use these conditions to their advantage in order to survive the overwhelming American numbers.  In addition to the campaign game covering the entire battle, War in the Wind also includes three smaller scenarios focusing on separate phases of the battle.

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.  Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.  David Powell has completely revised his earlier Thunder at the Crossroads. New scenarios allow more in-depth looks at particular actions of the battle (with smaller map and play times, too).

    "description":"This game is part of Excalibre’s PANZER BATTLES AND SIEGE SERIES (PBSS). The games in this series features a common four (4) page series rulebook and generally a four (4) page game specific rulebook, of which one page is the cover. The games of this series feature simple rules that are a quick study and low counter density. Most games feature step reduction and have substitute counters included in the counter mix.  CAEN 1944 features an 11x17 map and 100 counters. The units are divisions with some brigade\/regiments. Several units have step reduction.  From the rules introduction: After the Allied landings in Normandy in 1944, the main concern of Eisenhower was to expand the bridgehead and bring in supplies and new units. Ike thought Montgomery should have made more rapid progress in his attacks on Caen. One thing slowing down the British and Canadians was the preponderant numbers of SS and regular Panzer divisions facing the British along the Caen position.  Turning slow progress into a partial tactical victory, Montgomery held down this large German armoured strength while the Americans broke out on the other flank and cut off a large number of German troops in what became known as the ‘Falaise Pocket.’ In this game the Allied objective is to accomplish what Montgomery did only much sooner. The Axis objective is to stop the Allies in their tracks and destroy Montgomery's army group.  From the design notes: Caen is truly siege warfare with Panzer and armoured divisions leading the siege. The massive number of German Panzer and SS divisions employed at Caen were able to stop Monty cold for weeks.  This game uses a very complex sequence of play to bring in all the elements of the campaign.  In general, the SS was usually better equipped and stronger than a comparable Whermacht(sic) unit. Some SS units in this game are weaker than one would expect, this was due to the immense difficulty in reaching the front intact and because of Allied air harassment or they were being rebuilt when thrown into the campaign.  Caen helped the Allies tie the Germans down, but it would have been an even bigger victory for them if Monty had reached Falaise sooner. Now it's your turn to try or try to stop him.   By today’s games standards the complex sequence of play referred to in the design notes is a very relaxing stroll in the park.  Other games in the PBSS include: Caen 1944, Crimea 1941, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Cassino 1944, Ancient Conquest, Atlantis 12,500 B.C., Crete 1941, Edgehill 1642, and Tunisia 1943.",

    "description":"Overlord is a set of miniature wargame rules that cover tactical-level combat in Normandy from June to August, 1944. The rules are suitable for 1:300th to 28mm scale, though they work best for 15mm miniatures.  The ground scale for the game is 1\" equals 10 metres, 1 turn equals 2 1\/2 minutes, 1 model soldier\/vehicle equals 1 real soldier\/vehicle.  The basic unit for the game is an infantry squad or individual gun and crew or single AFV. Infantry are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle groups, light machine gun groups, heavy machine gun groups, light mortar groups. etc. Leaders, who represent platoon leaders and senior NCOs, are mounted singly.  The sequence of play follows traditional lines: Initiative, Move, Fire, Close Assault, Morale. However, there is a Watch and Shoot phase, where units can elect to fire before the normal Fire phase or hold their fire to take opportunity fire against the opponent's moving units. Only units with Watch and Shoot orders can take opportunity fire.  Firing is done by individual stands; there is no mechanism for combining the fire of several stands, though the results of fire combat can have a cumulative effect. Fire combat uses a unique system where a firing stand's weapon type is first cross-referenced with one of six major columns that represent the cover state of the target unit(s), then cross-referenced with the result of a modified die roll. Results can create individual casualties for a stand or, in a separate die roll, the loss of the entire stand. Because casualties represent the loss of single soldiers, a stand may take several casualties before it is lost.  Before units can be targeted for fire, they must be spotted. The visibility of units can be affected by  activities such as moving, firing, etc. Units might be very difficult to spot, which represents the historical difficulty of seeing the enemy in the dense terrain of Normandy. In larger games, keeping track of which units are spotted may be cumbersome.  Morale is strictly based on the performance of historical units. There is a special category called Fanatic that is used solely by units of the 12th SS \"Hitlerjugend\" division. This represents the relative inexperience of the troops combined with the fanaticism instilled in them through their Hitler Youth indoctrination. Most Allied units are classed as Inexperienced, which represents the fact that, though well-trained, they are experiencing combat for the first time. Other Classifications are Elite (such as Airborne units and most of the SS), Veteran (most German units), and Poor (such as German Ostbattalion units).  The antitank rules are fairly simply, but they tend to provide predictable historical results. The rules don't really seem to emphasize tank combat. Rather, tanks are added in as a specialized heavy weapon, but the rules are not intended for large tank vs. tank actions.  The game play allows for hidden set up and limited hidden movement, which can give the defender (usually the Germans) the ability to mount a very tenacious defense while being strongly outnumbered.  Overlord can be used to play games that consist of only a few squads or up to a full battalion on each side. However, larger games can be slow.  Many of the mechanics for Overlord are similar to the mechanics used in the designer's other WW2 tactical rules, \"Grey Storm, Red Steel.\"",

    "description":"Originally named \"Rosicrucian Chess,\" this is a four-handed chess variant that can be played as a game, or used as a divination tool. (The divination version requires the use of a die and an additional piece.) The game was invented in the Victorian era by the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in England. Despite the existence of extensive original instructions, no surviving manuscript gives perfectly unambiguous rules for play, so different modern authors have published instructions that do not always agree in all details. The first published version was in The Golden Dawn (1941) by Israel Regardie.  There are four different 8x8 boards, corresponding to the classical elements, of which only one is used in a given game session. Setup configuration of the pieces depends on which of the boards is being used, with four further variations possible within that decision. Ordinary game play involves partners seated across from one another, with their opponents at right angles to them: air and fire vs. water and earth. Setup is on the right-hand half of the nearest two rows, so that pawns generate a sort of spiral motion on the board as a whole.  Each player has nine chessmen (4 pawns, knight, queen, bishop, rook, and king), and piece movement varies slightly from standard modern chess, especially in the case of the queen. Pawns are promoted only to the corresponding piece of their native file. Each of the 36 chessmen has a correspondence to a given Egyptian god or goddess, and all of the board squares correspond to letters in the Angelic Tablets of Renaissance magicians John Dee and Edward Kelly.",

    "description":"4 armies are fighting to be the first to reach Queen Amidala on the green planet Naboo, to get her to one of their own bases.  The armies are 2 different teams: The Good ones and the Evil ones. Each player control one army (or sometimes 2 if you are 2-3 players) and tries to move any of his characters to Naboo, throwing 2 dices per turn, each for one character. When getting doubles, all four characters can be moved. On the way can you attack your opponents and with luck and skill render them harmless. But be careful, so your not attacked and eliminated yourself.  Armies from the same side are allies during the game and has to cooperate, ie to open a gate to Naboo, as the planet is protected by a shield. It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.  The combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.  When character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base. If Queen loses battle, the winning character is moved to center and control of the Queen is changed.  The game is based upon the the movie \"Star Wars Episode I\".  The game does probably only exist in Sweden, Norway and Finland. \"Kampen om Naboo\" = \"Fight for Naboo\".",

They will be releasing a game that apparently has been making the rounds of insiders for the past 10 years. The title: Paaren \/ Couples. It's a card-playing game. Each player plays cards. In one spot, one man can be matched with a suitable woman. Matches are determined by having at least two matching characteristics with both the location and the partner. These can be different, though. Players always have four characteristics, locations have two to six. There are influence cards which can break up matches as well as destroy them. Thankfully there are also other cards which offer protection against jealousy. The first player to reach a pre-set number of matches wins the game.  The game will be bilingual (German \/ English) and come with 120 individually illustrated cards. Since most will recognize the characters, it will be great fun to match those who might not seem to be such a good match to start.",

    "description":"Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.  With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.  The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.  Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.  The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.  The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.  Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.  Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.  The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.  Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.",

The first player to throw a six begins the race, moving along his route as many bars as he had thrown points. If a throw takes him to an obstacle, he must move back, miss a number of throws, or wait for his next move till a six is thrown, according to the directions on the board in each case. If a lucky throw lands him on to “Following Winds”, he moves forward as indicated.  The first player to reach Melbourne is the winner.",

    "description":"This 1890 game from Milton Bradley uses the Happy Families\/Authors mechanism of building sets by asking for cards, but complicates strategy through a set of bonus cards.  The game consists of 95 small card slips, roughly 2.5\" long by 0.5\" wide. Of these, 18 contain the name of a Longfellow poem, 72 have the name of the poem and two lines from it, and five contain the names of styles of edition bindings: Tree Calf; Full Morocco; Half Morocco; Cloth; and Paper. There also are six larger reference slips with the names of all 18 poems.  Players take turns asking for a poem or selections from a poem, and when they complete a set, play it down in front of them. They also may ask for an \"edition slip\", and if the asked player has one, he must hand it over. If he has more than one, he chooses which to hand over.  All but the Paper slip provide a bonus that applies to all sets scored at the time it is played. Bonuses are cumulative, so a doubled pair plus two more sets then tripled equals 18 points. However, whichever player is left with the Paper slip at the end of the game cuts his total score in half. Highest net score wins.  The game is listed by Alex G. Malloy (American Games, 1999) at p. 34, #1033.",

    "description":"Triplexity, and its sisters Triple-Triplexity, Duple, Double-Duple, and Monotony, were created in 1984. The designers had been playing Go, but couldn't find a balanced way to play three. So they created a grid composed of triangles laid into a hexagon shape, and designed Triplexity. Stones are played on the intersections of the grid-lines. The object of the game is to be the first player to get five or more stones in a row. Opponents' rows may be blocked, or their stones may be captured.  The designers describe the game:  \"Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents' play. Every placement of a game stone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities.  \"It is an aggressive, every one for themselves game; defensive alliances are short lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game taking generally not more than 10-15 minutes to play.\"  \"Offense writ large should be your plan; defense will follow from a superior offense. Quick moves will facilitate play and learning of the games.\"  From the original game manual (Copyright 1984):  \"TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a unique system that allows the playing of several different games. Presented here are the two best, TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM).  Although these two games are played with the same gemstones and on the same grid, they are significantly different, each involving different dynamics and requiring different strategies. TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 3) and its partner game TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) (a game for 6) offer something we have not seen before, a pure strategy game involving three adversaries. Each player must try to establish a winning position with a strong but flexible offense, while hindering their opponents play.  Every placement of a gemstone on the grid increases the possibilities and the complexities. As your skill improves you will realize more the dimensions and subtleties of this game. TRIPLEXITY(TM) is a surprisingly fast paced game. It is an aggressive , every one for themselves game, defensive alliances are short-lived and not to be trusted, the timid player rarely comes out on top with each game typically taking no more than 10-15 minutes to play.  TRIPLEXITY(TM) fits in well with the fast pace of our modern society, and by its nature is an appropriate metaphor for our times. DUPLE(TM) (a game for 2) and its partner game DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) (a game for 4) are closer to the traditional strategy game, in that the third adversary, the wild card of TRIPLEXITY(TM), is missing. But the unique dynamics of the TRIPLEXITY(TM) grid remain, as well as the added dimension of playing two stones per turn.  This simple difference alters the strategy significantly. In DUPLE(TM), even more so than in TRIPLEXITY(TM), hesitating to seize control can cost you the game.  Yet going for control too soon can be disastrous.  DUPLE(TM) is a game of timing as much as it is a game of position. From the feedback we have gotten we have found some people preferred one game over the other.  We find comparisons difficult because of the unique qualities of each game.   TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM), along with their partner games TRIPLE-TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DOUBLE-DUPLE(TM) as well as MONOTONY(TM) (a game for 1), cover such a range of possibilities that a truly excellent strategy game can be played with any number of people up to and including 6.  (Except 5, we have never been able to get this number to work well.  If you come up with something, we would enjoy learning how to play it!) TRIPLEXITY(TM) and DUPLE(TM) offers what we think are two of the best strategy games to have been discovered in a very long time.  If you are only an occasional game player we think you will find this to be one of the most fun and challenging game sets you have ever owned. If you are a frequent strategy game player then this one is a must and you will find, as we have, that it is a joy to play. In keeping with the quality of the games themselves we endeavored to bring them to you in a quality form. This is not cardboard and plastic and with proper care, your game should last you many years. Have fun.\"  \"HISTORY: In early July, the summer of 1984, John and I were playing Go - the ancient game of territory capturing and strategy of lines. While we were playing Mario came over so we decided to see if the game could be played by three. Well we played our version of Go-moku-narrabe and had a measure of success and fun. However, we were not very satisfied.  So we discussed rule modifications and also the idea of a different playing grid. We were all in agreement over this advance. After this the rules just seemed to come with the playoff this new game on our grid. The snatch and snug came as developments of our play over the next several weeks.  I remember suggesting the snatch and we were all in agreement, but thought it would have very few applications.  Then Mario said why not, since w e were able to capture a stone, be able to secure a point.  We all agreed on this advance and the game was set.  But as our skills grew we got closer to the edge and John did his blitz edge game on us.  Well, we are all wiser now. So when we got tired of sharing the world championship game among ourselves we decided to offer you these games of which we are so fond.\"",

The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system.  It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many fans felt the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification,  to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.

Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.  7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.  In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.  Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3–7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.",

The complete box includes also a couple of spare cards, some measurement cards that can be used to measure the size of your ear, and a c-cassette containing sound effects from the cards.  A single round of this game begins by dealing each player a certain amount of cards (10 - 16) depending on the number of players - more cards with less players. On each round every player has two goals: to get rid of all his\/her cards, and to collect sets of 3+ colored cards with a same text.  During each round The first player who manages to empty his\/her hand wins the round but isn't necessarily the player who receives the most points. That's because the most points are awarded from the collected sets. The winner, however, receives bonus points according to the cards still left in the hands of other players and other players get a lot of penalty from those cards. There is also a 100 point bonus awarded for a player who wins the round with only a single set on the board.  The game is played over multiple rounds which all are scored. The winner is the player who first reaches 500 points. Because the amount of points gained from a round can vary from -150 to +450 the games can last forever or only for less than an hour.  The fun part of the game is that when a player plays a card he\/she must say what's printed in the card, like: \"Splappa dap!\", \"Arra Argh Yargh\", or \"Fippaditty Fappaditty Fappa daMap!\" It comes naturally after a few games, believe me.",

Depending on how many items his\/her team guesses the team's pawn may advance 0, 1, 3 or 6 steps along the board. On the cards you have clusters of three terms per action to be taken. The action a player has to take (explain, draw, pantomime or knead) is decided on the field the pawn is situated on. You also have a flash symbol on the board. Whenever a pawn starts its move on the flash symbol, this goup must take an special card and one player has to do whatever is written on the card (e.g. \"non-sense\" like explain terms using a certain slang, stand and one leg and put off your shoes and socks, keep your breath for 90 seconds...).

While undated, it was probably issued around 1936-7, when a foundering Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team was rescued from a buyout and transfer to Albany, NY, by a group of local investors headed by former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor William Donald Ross.  The game itself is rather basic. It has a folding thin cardboard field and 18 small wooden player disks (9 blue, 9 red). While there are circles on the field and bench for these pieces, their only real function is to mark baserunners.  To bat, players simply roll 2D6, and read the resulting play off a 2-12 table in the rules. The odds are not realistic: the most likely result (7) produces a double, and a batter will get on base almost half the time (17\/36). Normal baseball rules apply, with the player scoring the most runs after nine innings winning.",

Goal cards are won by using mathematical operators to join cards in a grid into other cards which are set aside as goal cards.  The grid cards are revealed and re-hidden during the game, so there is a memory aspect as well.  The game can be played at multiple levels from early elementary (just learning addition and subtraction with two digit numbers) to teens who know multiplication and division well and are learning powers, roots, and the Fibonacci series.  Using a timer (not provided), you can handicap the game so that adults can play against young children.  The game teaches both regular numbers (1, 2, 3...) as well as Roman numbers.  All cards also use images of dice to help kids understand the connection between the abstract number and the quantity that it represents.  This can help anyone struggling with math, but it is especially helpful for certain special needs students.  The game was designed by a group of kids aged 10-15 as part of their First Lego League research project.  The game works well as a team game, if you have more than 6 players.",

Following the discovery of Confederate Special Order No. 191, which outlined the disposition of General Robert E. Lee's entire army across the countryside, Union commander Gen. George McClellan moved to catch the Rebel Army while it was so dispersed. At South Mountain, the Federal First and Ninth Corps tangled with an assorted Confederate force under D.H. Hill, who fought the battle of his life. Could he hold the Yankees at bay and buy enough time for Lee to pull his scattered army back together?  Thunder on South Mountain is a tactical, brigade-level simulation of low complexity with an emphasis on command and control. A unique \"army posture\" matrix determines the sequence of play each turn, and leader effectiveness is governed by a combination of momentum, luck, and resource management.

    "description":"Fields of Despair: France 1914-1918 is a 2-player hex-based strategic level block war game set on the Western Front of the First World War. Players take control of the Allies or Central Powers fighting the war on land, at sea, and in the air all the while making tough economic and technological decisions at home.  Fields of Despair has a unique block system designed to maintain the fog of war throughout the entire game. In most games, block combat values range from one to four. In Fields of Despair the range is zero to twenty.  The range in values makes Fields of Despair a very deceptive game. Players can build up a large force with a single block instead of giving away their strategy with a stack of blocks.  Movement is simple and free flowing. Players are allowed to “make change” during the movement phase. Thus a block with a combat value of 16 could be broken in two blocks of 8 before moving, or conversely two blocks could be combined into one. Zero-value blocks known as “Deception” blocks could also be part of the exchange. Thus after every movement phase you never really know the strength of your enemy.  The fog of war isn’t lost after first contact with the enemy. Blocks remain hidden even when enemies occupy the same hex and stay hidden until one player decides to allocate an air squadron for reconnaissance or sends his men across no man’s land.",

    "description":"Continuing the No Retreat! Series, where  the Russian Front of World War II was first simulated,  then taking the action to the African Front, the Italian Front , the French & Polish Fronts, game designer Carl Paradis now presents the fifth chapter: No Retreat 5: The Western Front 1944-45.  After the Fall of France in May of 1940, the Battle of Britain put a stop to Hitler’s ambitions in the West. While his attentions turned eastwards towards the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, the German Army, occupying most of Western Europe, started fortifying the coastlines to defend the Nazi dictator’s conquests against the resurgent Allied might: the vaunted “Atlantic Wall” was born. Soon, Allied troops will be knocking upon its doorstep…  In No Retreat 5, players command the Allied or German forces, invading or defending West Europe: France, Belgium, Holland and Germany proper. Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 20 kilometers across, over turns that each represent between a week to a month of real time. The No Retreat series card-assisted game system is there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable, and also manages the pre-invasion “fog-of-war”.  The game is split up in two different parts.  The Invasion Game:  Starting in 1943.  It will consist of the preparations preceding the Allied Invasion of Western Europe, with deception, intelligence and build-up efforts being showcased. The D-Day outcome is then gamed using intense weekly turns.  The Front Game: After the Allies are ashore, their beachhead secure (unless they are pushed back in the English Channel!), the rest of the game consists of monthly turns simulating the War in the West, up to the bitter end and probable surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945; the longer the game lasts, the stronger the Soviets position will be in Central Europe, or perhaps Hitler will be able to stave off total defeat long enough for an armistice and negotiated outcome?  The D-Day sea invasion will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, with both players having to choose where to deploy their assets, where to attack, and what kind of troops to use and request from higher command. As the German commander, will you ask the OKW for more Panzers, or more bunkers and guns; will you gain full control of your mobile troops, or will you have limited control, as historically happened? As the Allied commander, will troops fighting in Italy be released to you for an end-run South of France invasion? Or perhaps you will decide to invade the Low Countries instead, trying to capture the important port of Antwerp in a surprise operation?  A simple but effective supply system will show the constraints the victorious Allied Armies suffered for a good part of the campaign after breaking out of their invasion beachhead. Special Event cards will simulate effortlessly the events happening on the Eastern Front, the effects of the strategic bomber offensive, the political pressures put on both players’ operations by their respective leaders, etc. Will Hitler let you use the Panzer reserves in time? Will Churchill make a bit for a more upfront role for the British units? Will Heavy Bombers be released for more tactical uses? All this and more will be shown and simulated. Embark in your Landing craft, keep watch in your concrete Bunker, the Invasion is coming, and there will be No Retreat!  Western Front Scenario Listing Regular Campaign Game: The Invasion Game, followed by the Front Game. Players will thus have a lot of leeway in their initial Strategic Choices. What if the Allies had invaded in le-pas-De-Calais instead of Normandy? What if the German Panzers were moved closer to the beaches? Historical Campaign Game:  The Game starts with the Invasion game already pre-set, and the Normandy landings. Historical OOBs only. Invasion Game Scenario: Only the first part of the game is played up to the resolution of the D-Day Invasion. Depending on its level of success, the outcome of the rest of the campaign, and victory is then determined using a set of special tables. Front Game Scenario: Only the second part of the game is played, starting with the Normandy Breakout.  Components: One 22x34 Mapboard (mounted and two-sided)  Two sheets of 88, 2-sided square units (176 Total)  One sheet of 112, 2-sided round\/hex markers. One rule book (40 pages) One Scenario Book (24 pages) Six Play-aid cards Two decks of 55 Event Cards  Two 6-sided dice  Scale: Each unit is one Division or Corps: Each hex is about 20 kilometers from side to side for the main campaign map, smaller for the Invasion map.

If you said, \"CARROT\" you would score 3 points because C+A+R are 3 matching letters in sequence, common to both CAR and CARrot. If the Transportation Category item was AIRPLANE and you responded with the Vegetable - EGGPLANT, that would score 4 points because P+L+A+N are letters in sequence and in common to both airPLANe and eggPLANt.  In the game, one player turns over a category card and names 3 items from that category. After each player has written these items in the left column of their answer sheet, a second category card is revealed. All players then have one-and-a-half minutes to find Common Ground. The player with the highest score advances.

Each die has a custom face with its special symbol.  The game's main mechanic is that an attacker (the one in possession of the ball) succeeds in his or her action by rolling a number higher than or equal to the defender's; special symbols tend to trump numbers.  The dice are placed on the board such that the centers face off against each other, while the forwards go against the guards.  The game starts with a roll-off between the centers.  The winner gains the ball (represented by the offensive marker), which grants a bonus to the attacker's dice rolls.  Only forwards and centers can take shots to score points; the guards steal the ball.  All positions can pass among each other.  The first player to reach an agreed-on score wins and ends the game.",

Each card has multiple questions on the back about the pictured person.  The object of the game is to identify the person in the picture and then answer questions about that person. The questions asked are determined by a roll of two 6-sided dice. Rewards and penalties are also determined by the number on the dice roll. For example, if the player roles a 7, they answer Question 7 on the card, and receive 10 points if correct PLUS any bonuses indicated next to Question 7. Every time a player fails to answer a question, the opportunity to do so moves to the next player and the value for the correct answer goes up 5 points.  The \"Quizmaster\" role is first determined by a roll of the dice. This person queries each player in turn, and notes their score on the scorecard. Once all players have been quizzed, the Quizzmaster role then rotates clockwise.  The accompanying 94-page booklet contains additional biographical information about each celebrity.",

But now a freak accident has occurred at the Cogtower, scattering cogs all over town and sending the clockwork winders into chaos. The Cogmen must repair the Cogtower before it is too late.  Each player directs a handful of resourceful Cogmen to gather cogs and repair the Cogtower. Each turn, a Winding card will be drawn from the deck, and any Cogmen standing adjacent to a Winder will be wound up by that amount, gaining Energy. Once all the Winding cards have been used, a Rainy Day card is added and the deck is reshuffled. If a Rainy Day card is drawn, any Cogmen who don’t find shelter will get wet and rust (a terrible fate!)  Beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving all of their Cogmen, who must spend Energy to move. At the end of the turn, any Cogmen dangerously low on Energy (and not near a Winder) may make a Desperation move, one last push towards a Winder before becoming unwound. A Cogman that becomes unwound is inoperable until he is wound up by an ally.  Cogmen gather the cogs that are scattered about Cogsburg, returning them to the Cogtower to gain victory points, or he may choose to repair a broken\/rusted Cogman instead. A Cogman can only carry a single cog at a time (They’re very heavy!)  Once the Cogtower has been rebuilt, final scores are tallied. Each player recieves one Victory Point for every cog they supplied to the Cogtower, plus an additional point for each operable Cogman.  The basic game is for two players. Rules for three players and four-player team play are included. Official rules for entirely cooperative play are forthcoming.",

    "description":"Strategy & Tactics magazine #30.  Time Scale: ? day per turn  Map Scale:  .75 km per hex  Unit Scale: Platoon\/Company  After SPI sold their groundbreaking Eastern Front wargame, PanzerBlitz, to Avalon Hill, designer James F. Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as \"Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944\".  From the Design Notes:  \"PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the \"confusion factor\", which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.  Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!\"  The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of \"new and improved\" tactical wargame systems.",

Then send your pirates aboard enemy ships to plunder their treasure!  In each round of the game, players take turns divvying up shares of Loot to gain Rum, Relics, Objects, and Pirates. In some rounds, when ships are flying close together, they will also clash in a Boarding action, using the effects of any Pirates they picked up to gain Doubloons and plunder Loot.  On your turn, take the first of the three shares of Loot on the table, and look at it secretly. You must decide to either take all the cards in the Share then add the top card from the deck face-down to this Loot space, or to leave the Share and look at the next one. If you choose to do the latter, add the top card from the deck to the Share you declined (or a Doubloon, if there's already three cards), thus increasing its value for the next player. If no shares interest you, blindly take the top card of the deck.  The card backs give you a hint about what’s in the next Shares: Pirates to board other ships, legendary Relics to collect, Rum to be scored at the end of the game, and Items with permanent, immediate, or secret effects.  Every 4 or 5 rounds (depending on the number of players), Boarding action will occur! Add the strength of your Captain and your Pirates, apply any bonuses or penalties, and face your two neighbors! For each victory, your Pirates will gain Doubloons or steal some Loot! After the fight, all Pirates are discarded.  The game ends after 12 (or 15) rounds.

    "description":"Out-golf up to 71 simultaneous opponents in this riveting game of strategy and luck. Choose between 9 and 18 holes to make the game longer or shorter (about 1-2 hours of play time). Each of the 18 holes is represented by a unique, hand-drawn map of the area, which is divided into small segments to help players gauge the approximate distance from the tee-off point to the green. Players use different colors of golf ball pawns to track their progress across each map. Just as with actual golf, players will attempt to complete the game in the fewest number of \"strokes\" possible. For each stroke, a player will first decide whether or not they wish to spin for a \"distance bonus\"--a free number of segments they are allowed to move their pawn toward the hole. This can be advantageous, but a bad spin also has the potential to land the player in a dangerous sand trap or water hazard (both of which carry a stroke penalty), so the decision should not be made lightly. After resolving or skipping this spin, the player then decides how many dice to throw, from 1 to 3, attempting to land as close to the green as possible. Each pip on the dice represents the player's ball moving forward 1 segment; therefore, if too many or too few dice are thrown, players can easily fall short of, or overshoot, their goal. Once a player lands on the green, they attempt to putt their way into the hole, which involves slightly different dice-rolling mechanics.  At the beginning of the game, each player is also given a number of Skill Cards which can be spent in various ways: 1. A Skill Card can be discarded before a roll to add an extra die. This is helpful for players who wish to have a longer drive, thereby increasing their chances of avoiding a large number of hazards or traps near the center of a map. 2. If a player does land in a hazard or trap, he or she may discard a Skill Card to ignore the stroke penalty of that hazard or trap. 3. A Skill Card may be used to change one die result on a player's putting roll, thereby refining the putting accuracy. 4. Finally, any unspent Skill Cards can be used at the end of the game to subtract a stroke from one's own score, or to add a stroke to an opponent's score.  Also includes a solo variant in which the player attempts to finish all 18 holes in under 72 strokes. This goal is then adjusted according to the player's level of success.",

    "description":"A simple card game of empire-building rivalry.  There are some 15 territory cards rated 1 through 3, some of which are dealt out to the players at the start (each gets a 1 and a 2 territory).  There are Revolt and Cannon cards.  The remaining cards are Development cards, each rated from 1 to 6.  On your turn, you draw a card and play or discard one.  The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.  When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1×, 2× or 3×) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.  Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.  Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.  Plundered cards must be allocated to your territories right away or discarded.  Cannon can also be used, if rated four or better, to empty one of your territories from its development cards so as to redeploy them - in effect, you are raiding yourself.  A number of small variant rules are supplied in the rule book.  The cards are printed in French, English and Dutch.  It is good strategy to build your hand for the end game, so you can, for example, protect a territory with a Revolt, then unprotect it, redeploy Development cards with a strong Cannon, and complete the territory's development with your last few card plays.

    "description":"Publisher's summary Putzroboter is the German name for a robotic vacuum cleaner.  Divide and clean up the mess of paper clips on the table.  When the game starts, there should be four different colors of paper clips spread out randomly on the table. Deal the paper clip cards to assign each player a particular color of paper clips to clean up. Take turns pushing around the robotic vacuum cleaner to collect the paper clips.  There is a magnetic ball contained within the robot. When the robot comes close to a paper clip, it will be able to pick up the paper clip. Collect your own paper clips but beware of picking up the clips belonging to a color of another player. If you do, you must give them the paper clip.  It’s important to move in a manner in which you pick up only your own color of paper clips as much as possible. Sometimes the robotic vacuum cleaner will move somewhere you didn’t think it would go. It’s difficult to balance your thinking between the degree of strength, direction, and other factors required to progress as planned.  The first player to pick up all the paper clips of their own color is the winner.

    "description":"Meaning - \"Hail Caesar, those who are about to die salute you\"  Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant is a game of Gladiator combat in a Roman Gladiator arena.  It has 1 to 4 combatants \"Gladiators\", plus Beasts, and Slaves! The mechanics are slightly similar to Combat in the Lists with a new hex tile game board for the arena, 7 direction movement, new character sheets with abilities, new weapons and armor, beasts; such as lions and bears, slaves \"non-trained\" combatants, new tactics, and all new images and graphics for cards and components.  Each Gladiator has nine equipment counter locations on his reference card:  Head Left shoulder Right shoulder Chest Groin Right hand Left hand Right leg Left leg  These [9] locations can hold [9] different pieces of equipment which can be picked up before the match.  These new counters make up part of the new mechanics of the game where the equipment and weapons are represented by counters and cards!  The counters fit into specific locations on the player’s reference cards and are distributed before the match through a process where each Gladiator takes turns picking a certain number of equipment pieces from an rack.  This process can leave the Gladiators with a mix-match of different types of equipment and weapons but also make for a different game each time its played.  Each equipment counter is also represented by a Equipment Defense point card, which is used to keep track of the amount of damage a piece of equipment takes during a combat session.  This new system makes up the other part of the new mechanics for Ave Caesar...  Each piece of equipment depending on its type will use up to three different D6 die to help record the amount of damage that piece of equipment can take before it becomes useless. Once the piece of equipment take its max damage allotment, it no longer prevents damage from hitting the player.  Once equipped, the Gladiators take turns moving, fighting, repositioning, devising tactics and strategies to maneuver into position for the best attack and defense. If a Gladiator is killed all his equipment “counters” are placed on top of his player piece and are available to any of the combatants in the arena!  Each weapon and piece of equipment has a card explaining the attack and defense characteristics.  Attach and Defense cards are used for combat to help devise a tactical strategy against other players.  This game will consist of the following components: A combat arena Gladiator player reference cards Weapon cards Equipment Defense point cards Animal cards Slave cards Attack cards Defense cards Specialty type cards for combat and defense - Attack and Defense styles Player game board pieces Animal game board pieces  Slave game board pieces Movement cards etc...

    "description":"The objective of this game is that as each player obtains sponsorship money they must invest it to build a Formula One racing team.  To do this, the players complete four laps of the Game Board before entering the first Grand Prix. Whenever a player lands on Car, Engine, Engineer or Driver squares, they can purchase these various elements to form a racing team.  Once a team has been formed, players then complete one lap of The Jigsaw Board. The Jigsaw board consists of six double-sided track sections, which can be combined in various ways to create all sixteen circuits around which the players will race. Clever.  Players move their cars around each circuit in procession. No dice rolls. The mechanics of racing come from overtaking lanes, which are positioned at critical points around the track. To overtake and improve your race position, you move your car into an overtaking lane and draw an overtaking card for either a straight and a corner. These cards list different elements that must be compared to the car you are overtaking.  For example, You succeed if CAR + ENGINE + ENGINEER ratings are higher.  This is the crux of the game. If you have assembled a team with high ratings then overtaking will succeed and therefore your team will succeed. Whoever has the highest points after 16 races wins the championship.",

    "description":"Buying castles in Scotland can turn out to be excellent business. Even more so when, at the same time, you can provide tourists with these lands attractions: natural beauties? Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too “populated” will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...  Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs “picture” or “ghost”. Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?  In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth. Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.  Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.  The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he\/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself\/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.  Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for “special auctions”, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.  English, German and Italian Rules available for download here",

    "description":"This game is vaguely similar in play to Careers without the strategy.  The similarities are in that there are different tracks players can take, however players have no choice where they go.  Roll and move and do whatever the spaces say to do.  Pieces move around an outside blue track if their piece is male and the inside pink track if female.  This is purportedly so the men can protect the women.  Players move by rolling 2 dice, if on outside track, and 1 die if on inside track or \"Profession\" track.  Men start with paychecks of $710 and Women with $300.  The first player to reach 10 status points and have $20,000 wins.  Of course, the odds are so stacked that the lesson here is that no matter what a woman does she cannot come out ahead.",

    "description":"(from Decision Games website:)  The 19th century saw the great imperial powers of Europe clash in titanic battles to establish control over the continent. Empires at War simulates four of these battles.  The Basic Game allows beginners to learn quickly, while providing experienced players an exciting evening of action. The Advanced Game fully simulates grand tactics of this period. Rules include provisions for light infantry (jaegers and chasseurs), command control, morale, fog of war, and mitrailleuse (early machine guns).  - Inkerman, 5 November 1854  At the height of the Crimean War, the Russians made a determined attempt to break out of Sevastopol. After a desperate day of fighting in rough terrain and fog, the Russians nearly broke the outnumbered Allies, but fell back with severe losses.  - Solferino, 24 June 1859  A decisive clash between the French\/Sardinian and the Austrians came at the town of Solferino. The narrow French\/Sardinian victory over Austria was due to the intrepid leadership of individual French corps commanders.  - Koniggratz, 3 July 1866  The decisive battle of the \"Six Weeks War\" came after a month of preliminary maneuvering. After a day of bloody see-saw fighting, the Prussian Second Army suddenly appeared on the northern flank, rolling up the Austrian line.  - Gravelotte-St. Privat, 18 August 1870  The decisive action occurred near the great fortress of Metz. The situation might have turned in favor of the French, but hesitation allowed Von Moltke to regroup and prepare a flanking maneuver that assured a German victory.  Components:       400 counters     16-page rule book     4 maps on (2) 22\" x 34\" mapsheets     1 inch box      (BGG description:)  Quad game depicting 4 battles fought during the 19th century: Inkerman (1854), Solferino (1859), Königgratz (1866) and Gravelotte (1870).  Lots of chrome rules, including command control,different weapon types and morale.  Nato style counters.  Four maps (3 large and 1 small). Inkerman,whilst fought on the smallest map due to the small battlefield, is a standout. Games are always close and are extremely accurate and well designed and researched.

Players start the game be marking three pre-set locations on a 7x7 field with either Xs or Os. The remaining spaces show either cows or numbers 1-5. On a turn, the player rolls five dice up to three times, keeping any number of dice she wishes after each roll. If after the third roll she has either two cows or three of the same number showing on the dice, she can mark one of these spaces on the grid with an X or O as appropriate. (If she has both two cows and three of a kind, she marks only one space.)  If she has a four-of-a-kind of either cows or one number, she marks one space, then takes another turn — but on this turn she must mark a space adjacent (either orthogonal or diagonal) to the previously marked space. If she continues to get quartets, she can keep marking spaces and taking additional turns.  The game ends as soon as one player has created a chain of marks that connects her three starting locations, and this player wins. If a player blocks off one of the opponent's starting locations, then this opponent had best do the same in order to ensure a draw; otherwise she's sure to lose!",

A key feature is that the game requires no erasing, so once an adventure is completed, the player can see every action they took on the page.  Players begin by designing a character using the games five skills, Dexterity, Ranged, Endurance, Accumen and Melee. Purchase equipment, and then set off to fight or outwit a dungeon full of monsters, finally clashing with the boss.  Players track their movement through the dungeon on a 5x6 grid. Upon entering a room, roll a die, add your depth, and look up the resulting number in the Bestiary. This can reveal anything from a chest full of loot, to a deadly trap, to a terrifying monster. Once they know what they're dealing with, players can choose how they want to deal with the situation. A roguish character may want to sneak past, or even risk pickpocketing a monster. A stronger character might simply choose a direct attack. A magically attuned character might try casting a charm spell. Each of these actions are performed using a single die roll, and players get a bonus based on thier character's statistics.  Sometimes a player might not be able to play to their strengths, such as an archer running out of arrows, or a swordsman fighting a flying enemy. Fortunately they can use a variety of magical potions to help even the odds, though it's probably best to try them before you need them, since the first time you try a potion of a given colour, you don't know what it will do.",

    "description":"BARBARIANS & EMPIRES - OCCIDENT ARENA, takes you and your fellow players to the ancient world at the beginning of the third century BC. In this edition you are fighting for the supremacy in the western Mediterranean and Western Europe, the geographical area which the Romans and Byzantines designated as Occident. In the western Mediterranean powers, the Greeks, the Carthagians and the Romans compete for hegemony; in the north are powerful nations such as the Celts, Germans, and Dacians, who, if they are not at war to each other, aspire to the warm, sweet and rich regions of the South. The Iberians fight for their own survival. It was the time shortly after the Celtic storm on Rome, done by Brennus and after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the period of the Punic wars, followed by the beginning of the Germanic invasions of the Cimbri and Teutones, which once again placed Rome at a great danger. They were defeated only by consul Marius after his military reforms. Now you play for the supremacy in the Occident in those last pre-Christian centuries, in which the gates of the Roman Temple of Janus were only closed once. Choose your people and win!  While playing, you have to successfully develop several skills to win, namely those of a military strategist, a prudent economist and a skilled diplomat. Increase your empire revenue through urban development, conquests and through your navy, which dominates the trade revenue in sea zones. Use your diplomats and support your army leaders or trade with other players, instigate revolts, gain neutral provinces peacefully, manipulate the opposing army commander, or send huge sums of money to support your allies. Secure your domains by garrison troops and fortifications. Build powerful armies, recruit the best of your people to increase the performance of your army, and develop strategies to force your powerful enemies to their knees. Hope, that Fortuna favors you. May the gods be with you!  Reach the supremacy of your nation in the Occident. You can achieve this dominance by leading the victory-chart at the end of 8 rounds or you can eliminate one of your adversaries in a Deathmatch by conquering his last province. Several winners in different order categories are possible. If a last province of an opponent has been conquered by your army, you place one of your markers on the skulls on the game board. No matter how the game evolves, you are one of the game winners, as long as you do not lose your last province, too. Any player remains in the game until he has completely lost his last province (does not apply to the nation of BRITANNIA, they stay always in the game!)",

To set up, fill the board with all the pawns, placed at random. Before starting the game, each player can exchange their Emperor pawn with another of their pawns elsewhere on the board. On your turn, you must do both phases in this order: the action phase, then the reinforcements phase. During the action phase, you must perform one single action:       Move: Move to an empty space, regroup or attack; you can attack only a stack of enemy pieces that contains strictly fewer pieces than the attacking stack — except that a stack of four pieces can be attacked and destroyed by a stack of one piece.        Construct: You can construct only one building per space; subsequent construction on the same space replaces the existing building. Each terrain type allows specific types of construction. In order to construct a building on an empty space or on a space already containing one of your buildings, you must sacrifice pieces from a single stack adjacent to this construction space.    Once per turn, you can take an extra action by sacrificing three stackable pieces. A stack that contains the Emperor can attack an enemy stack even if it contains an equal number of pieces, and even if it contains another Emperor. Each enemy Emperor you have captive is worth 3 VP.  During the reinforcements phase, if you have pieces in your reserve, you must return at least one piece to play if you can. You can place up to three pieces onto a single stack of your color on the board (never on an empty space), respecting the following rule: You cannot place reinforcements on a stack if it is adjacent to another player's building.  The game ends immediately when a player has amassed 12 VP by adding up the values of his buildings on the board and any Emperors they have captured — each village is worth 1VP, each tower 2VP, and each castle and captured Emperor 3VP — and they have at least one palace. Alternatively, if a player is the only one with pieces remaining on the board (making reinforcement impossible for the other players), they win.",

In Smash & Grab, you choose a location to pull off your heist, choose 2 of 6 possible characters to perform the heist with, and then alternate revealing new events that occur during the heist and playing actions to a timeline in order to get in, grab the loot, and get out.  The game centers around resource management. Every round, a card from the event deck will be played to the timeline, which will increase the 'bad' resources (threat, fatigue, and setbacks) and limit your ability to gain the 'good' resource (progress). Then, players will take turns playing a card to the timeline to counteract these 'bad' resources while gaining as much progress as possible.  Each player has a hand of general action cards and starts the game with 3 powerful character-specific actions. Each action card adds or subtracts one or several resources, as well as sometimes giving the player access to powerful abilities such as looking through the action or event decks.  The resources are kept track of on shared boards. Each minute of the timeline has a threat track to keep track of the amount of threat you have minute-to-minute. Additionally, there is a progress and fatigue mat that is used in combination with specific tokens to keep track of your current totals for those resources.  If you are able to accumulate enough progress while keeping threat and fatigue low enough before you run out of space on the timeline or the event deck runs out, then you win.",

The gameboard has a fort which houses the 12 cavalry markers while on the opposite side of the board an Indian village houses the 12 Indians.  A one-way path winds around the board, with the Indians moving in one direction, while the cavalry move in the opposite, which means they'll come head to head in a short while.  The Indians player leads off, spinning the spinner, which has values of 0 to 10; the player moves his first marker accordingly.  The cavalry player follows in suit.  On the next Indian spin, the player moves the Indian marker already in play and adds a new one from the village, each moving the distance the spinner indicates. Play continues on with each player soon moving several of his markers on each turn.  Each marker counts for 10 men, and there are several spaces scattered across the board which, when landed upon, indicate you must lose 10 men.  Essentially, that marker is removed from the game, not to return.  Also, when a player lands on an opponent's marker, he captures that piece and moves into his fort or village.  Additionally, a few spaces allow a player to raid his opponent's fort or village and re-capture his captured markers.  Eventually, through such attrition, one player will find he has no markers left out on the trail.  At that point, if he is holding some of his opponent's markers captive, he may trade his captives for his own markers, place them in his respective fort or village, and move them into play as normal.  If, however, a player has no markers on the trail, and no captives in his fort or village, he loses the game, giving his opponent the victory.  Thus, the markers have no end destination and may move round and round the board, victory coming only when the opponent has lost all of his markers.",

Recently, you find yourself in the back room of Rasmuson's Bookshop in the heart of Easley by the River. There, on shelves heavy with dust, you find a leather bound volume and from between its pages a letter drops. Its author describes a fabled ancient brass clock and navigation device, the Antikythera, whose 6 parts were disassembled and hidden in the city of Val Justinia to prevent it from falling into the hands of a shadowy cabal operating within the S.C.E's very halls. The letter goes on to say that if the cabal and its allies, the Federation of Air Pirates, were to discover this device, they could wreak untold havoc, potentially circumnavigate the globe and attack Arkady’s eastern border.

In order to facilitate this process, players will use their Geld (money) to hire Dragon Lairds (aristocrats) and buy Resources (buildings) and Commoners (peasants).  You can use precious Royals (your victory points) to acquire Dragon Havocs, which empower you to do anything from getting extra cash, to stealing things from your opponents.  The Havocs tend to be one-shot little guys, however, and are always discarded to the bottom of the discard deck, as far out of reach as possible from those cards that pilfer the discard pile.  At the end of each round, you accumulate the Geld and Royals that your acquisitions generate for your clan.  At the end of the game, you additionally receive any Finale Royals on cards as end-game victory points.  From the Margaret Weis web site:  Deep in the heart of an island continent, many years ago, was a long forgotten land of ancient Saureans… Dragons of all sizes and shapes, who had, through the generations tamed the foolish races of men, dwarves, and elves that lived among them. Over the centuries, they refined their techniques and now were trying to gain control over all the surrounding dragon countries. There could be only one Dragon Monarch, but who would it be?  At the start of the game, each player is given a dragon clan and chooses to play either the king or queen of that clan.  The object is for your clan to score the most points in Royals by the end of the game and thus become the ruling Dragon Monarch.",

Petteia XXI is played with light and dark pieces, checkers or stones initially lined up on opposite sides of the board. It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.  The objective is to stalemate the opponent or to capture his entire army.  Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Petteia XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:       Push and Crush Attack      Flank Attack      Phalanx Attack     Aditionally, Petteia XXI has locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.  http:\/\/www.chessvariants.com\/invention\/petteia-latrunculi-xxi",

Working together as a team, players must stabilize the global populations of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles before time runs out or the damage done to the planet’s biodiversity is beyond repair.  Using unique character skills, combined with team strategy and a bit of luck, players travel the globe encountering real-world destruction events and conservation strategies as they try to bring an end to the worldwide Extinction Crisis. The overall health of the global animal populations is tracked on the Population Growth Index (PGI) chart on the board. For victory, each animal population must be “stabilized” by raising its PGI marker above the zero value. The primary method to do this is for a player to successfully complete a Reaction card during their turn. These scientifically accurate cards are a major determining factor towards the team’s overall success.  However, at the start of each player’s turn an Occurrence Card is drawn. These cards guide the story and introduce real-world events and challenges that must be overcome. But be careful… Just when you think you’re in the clear you could be hit with a Destruction Event, causing an entire species to become endangered or a local habitat to be destroyed. Other actions allow players to meet these challenges and progress towards their final objective. Players must also pay attention to the health of the world’s waterways, invertebrates, and plants. Neglect any of the 3 main charts (PGI, IP, and Ocean) for too long and the consequences could be disastrous: a smart team balances the needs of all 3 charts continuously throughout the game to achieve victory.  Extinction Crisis presents players with a daunting task and requires them to find solutions, adapt to challenges, and overcome the very real crisis facing the planet.  With only 10 turns each, how will you rise to the occasion?",

The playing board is comprised of 25 squares in a 5 x 5 grid.  Each square is further subdivided into 4 quadrants.  The squares are colour coded by colour and number so that a throw of the two dice (one numbered, one coloured) will indicate a particular square.  Taking it in turns players throw the dice and are asked a question determined by the colour of the square.  Questions are in five categories (Blue - Language, Purple - First, Red - People and Places, Yellow - Names, Green - Words).  Each player has a choice of three answers, only one of which is correct.  If a player correctly answers the question one of his or her playing pieces is placed on one of the quadrants within the square relating to that question.  The same player then continues with another roll of the dice and another question, until a question is answered incorrectly at which point play passes to the next player.  The first player to roll the dice and correctly answer questions to achieve at least one scoring piece in 5 squares forming a line either up, across or diagonally is the winner.

These dice can range from the standard D6 numbered 1 to 6 in one color to any D6 you can imagine, by mixing colors and numbers.  For example, you can create a die like this: Green 1 - Green 5 - Blue 1 - Red 4 - Yellow 6 - Yellow 6.  There are 2 types of Nestortiles:  A-Type: The interlocking teeth are short, so the edges of the assembled dice are flush, suitable for making a single die, for example.  B-Type: The interlocking teeth are about double in length, allowing you to connect multiple tiles or dice in order to create more complex 3D structures.  Moreover, you can customize the tiles by drawing on their backs with a permanent marker or by adding stickers, and create your own designs!

    "name":"Fur Out",
    "description":"Developed by a real-life fur trapping couple, Fur Out was marketed as Canada's first \"family wildlife game.\"  The game, not just a simple roll and move affair, features three different types of characters (Trappers, the Game Warden, & the Anti-Trapper). Trappers set traps and score points by catching & selling furs. As they accumulate wealth, trappers can buy and build cabins on the board to set trap-lines to make even more money. Trappers can also tamper with each others traps and even steal them. However, if the Game Warden (only one allowed per game) catches them they can end up in jail. The Game Warden is also a trapper, so he can cash in on any poached game he seizes, as well as set traps himself. (However, as a lawman the Game Warden can't tamper with other player's traps.) The Anti-Trapper (only one allowed per game) scores by stealing traps from the Trappers and generally making life miserable for them.  Players navigate the unusual snowshoe-shaped board by rolling 2 six-sided dice and traveling along the showshoe's webbing. Different spots on the board allow players to set up traps for various game animals. (These spots are always on the edges of diamond or hexagonal areas that frame the illustration of the animal to be trapped.) Some animal hides are virtually worthless (like the lowly Skunk) while others pay top dollar (like the mighty Grizzly Bear). Only one trap may be set per square. A player must return to the square by landing on it with an exact die roll to successfully make a catch. Unfortunately, other players that land on the square may \"steal\" a catch from the trap. However, the offending player may be sent to jail for poaching if the Game Warden lands on the spot while they're still there.  Initially trappers are restricted to the first level of the board, but when they successfully trap an animal, they may progress another level down the board, repeating the process as they bag bigger and better game. Cards from the Fur In deck (collected when traps catch animals) make movement, and therefore scoring, more predictable. Cards from the Fur Out deck (collected when larger traps catch bigger animals) allow players to slowly collect letters to spell out the names of the animals with the biggest ticket furs... and to eventually make top dollar. A deck of event cards, name Yellowhead Cards (after the nickname of a famous Iroquois trapper\/trader named Pierre Bostonais) can significantly alter a player's turn. This deck is activated by landing on particular spaces spread around the board. (Interestingly, the Anti-Trapper player is instructed to interpret the Yellowhead Cards to the best of his ability from his perspective. Some Yellowhead Cards simply won't apply to the Anti-Trapper.)  Players are allowed to trade or sell any in-game items to each other. This even applies to things like players combining Fur Out cards so that they can divide up a big score.  As the game progresses, players can buy Cabins to effectively take over certain game spaces for themselves. However this becomes an attractive target for the Anti-Trapper who'll want to burn the cabin down (as long as he can stay out of reach of the Game Warden).  The game may be played to a time limit (Trapping Season) or to any other method of conclusion that they players can agree on. The winner is the player with highest cash value of combined resources (traps, cabins, and, of course, furs) when the game ends.  The game includes the following components: - 1 Showshoe Playing Board - 7 Colored Playing Tokens - 6 Colored Sets of 50 Traps each - 10 Wooden Trappers Cabins - 1 Pair of Dice - 3 Different Sets of Cards (Fur In, Fur Out, & Yellowhead) - 1 Pad of FUR Out Scoresheets - 1 FUR OUT Rules Booklet - 1 FUR OUT Player Aid Sheet",

The game is meant to serve as an entertaining vehicle by which students and practitioners in education can discuss and evaluate issues, trends, as well as their individual motivations, in K-12 education.  Each “turn” players deal five cards and then take turns drawing a card from those that remain. The drawn card’s Event is revealed\/ read aloud to the others after which players can bid for the event by playing cards from their deck. The winner of the bidding will then take procession of the card, adding it to their “Portfolio”. A card that is not claimed will go into the discard pile. Instead of drawing a card a player can also “Pass” and exchange any or all of the cards in their hand for new cards from the deck, or to “cash in” the point values of their cards to advance their “Epistemology, Axiology or Political” track markers. Players can also exchange cards in their deck for “Mentor” cards that can be used for various game functions.  The goal of each player is to acquire a portfolio of Challenge and Opportunity event cards, as well as a number of sufficient Axiology, Epistemology and Political points to pass the Praxis III (professional licensing) exam and win the game. It is possible for all, some or none of the players to win the game by the last turn.  So you want to teach? Learn, discover, reflect, and enjoy!  Graphics by Bruce Yearian.

And you promise that this next one would really be your last - and you survive yet again! Nothing beats that moment of suspense as you push your luck to the extreme, only to be rewarded by  glorious victory for your bravery.  In the light and casual game Queen of the Hill, players are queens vying for control of a celestial hill. Taking turns, they attempt to Gather, Form and Keep the strongest female warriors from different worlds and eras to join their army. However, this is a very dangerous act, and they cannot always control what they Gather. At the end of every round, players compare their total warrior scores Formed and the highest score wrests control of the hill. Control the hill twice and a player wins the game! Watch out though, the Dark One (also the only male in the game) might accidentally be Gathered and he will prey upon all the ladies. If you push your luck too hard, you might end up drawing him, and he will clear all your points and force you to end your gathering phase. How lucky are you feeling today? How far do you dare to push your luck? The more you push your luck without drawing the Dark One, the more likely the next opponent will attract him. And the more you push your luck, the more your foes are forced to push theirs if they are to beat you! The pressure is ON!  In this game when a female warrior is Gathered (drawn from the deck), a player has the option of Forming her into the current fighting group for that round and her Battle Points will be counted for the player's total score in that same round, or the player can choose to Keep her in his hand instead. If he Keeps her in his hand, she will not contribute any Battle Points to the player's score this round and be set aside for now. She does not go into the player's hand immediately. Only after the current round ends will all such Kept cards go to their players' hands, where they can now be played at critical moments to turn the tide against other players. An interesting thing to note is that Gathering is secretive. Other players will never know the actual total score of a player in a round (unless the Dark One wipes them out), but they will know the amount of cards drawn by the player so they can make a rough guess.",

    "description":"Castle of the Devil is a 4-8 player card game.  All players are passengers within a carriage that is rushing to Devil's Castle. They each act as a member of a secret association, but no one knows who is friend and who is foe.  Each player starts in one of two secret associations. He also gets a secret profession with a special ability. So at the beginning of the game you have no information about the membership and the professions of the others. To win the game, each association has to collect 3 defined artifacts jointly. Therefore you have to find out who your allies are and where to find the artifacts among the other secret objects that are in possession of other players. You can get this information during the game either by trading objects with other players, because every object has a special ability, e.g. \"Trade it in and you may take a look at your trading partners-association.\" or by struggling with other players, because the winner of a struggle can view the cards of the underdog and steal one of them. But be careful, all players can support the attacker OR defender in a struggle. If they know about your identity but you don't know theirs it may be risky to struggle.  Turn actions, one of: Trade Duel Spy - Choose another player and draw one random object card from her\/his hand. Look at this object without revealing it to the other players. Then give it back to her\/him. Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, OR declare the opposing team and their items.  If someone refuses a trade you offer, you get a duel token as compensation. These tokens are used as extra votes that can be applied in future duels. Duels: Everyone declares sides secretly and simultaneously. Then anyone can apply items, professions and duel tokens in any order. Players must declare for one or the other and abstentions are not allowed.  Victory: Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, then one by one. If you name players on your team incorrectly or they don't have the object(s) you lose. You can also declare victory by announcing the opposing team and the members of that team holding their objects by naming them, as firstly part of the team, and secondly that they have a relevant object. If you get the player's team wrong or they don't have the object(s) you lose.  Reimplements: Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg",

Um, I mean, is it possible or will they fail?  Each round, one player picks a question card — with questions for a child or adult depending on who she intends to confront — then she chooses a victim and starts peppering the player with questions. If the victim ever utters \"yes\" or \"no\" when answering, the first player to slap the bell advances her token on the game board. If the victim hesitates too long or answers only with the same vague responses, such as \"I don't know\", slap that bell! If the victim makes it through the questioning without uttering the forbidden words, however, then she advances on the track. The first player to reach the center of the game board wins.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 & 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 & 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 & 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost.  A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.",

Chimera for three players is a game of two against one. In each hand, one player bids to be Chimera and the other two players team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat this player. Players compete for points in several hands of play, and the winner is the player who scores the most points once the designated point score is reached by one or more players. Chimera is normally played to 400 points, although longer or shorter games may be played. Chimera for three players was previously published as Chimera by ZMAN Games.  Chimera for five players plays similarly to Chimera for three players, but with additional cards and rules. One player bids to be Chimera, then chooses one other player to be their partner (the Pi Ya) through a bid system; the other three players then team up as the Chimera Hunters to defeat them.

In more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.  If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.",

    "description":"Game from Games and Puzzles magazine, issue 38.  The game is for 2-6 players and is played on a board laid out as shown in the diagram. Each track or run is in two parts, the Base along the edge of the board, and the Approach. Each pair of Base and Approach runs would be of a different colour, but are lettered in the diagram for the purpose of identification. Each player would have a cube, of the same colour as his track. This cube is marked from 1-6 in a similar fashion to a dice, but with ants replacing the usual spots. A collection of ants' eggs with a container and a normal die complete the equipment. The eggs are quite simple to make from papier mache, plaster or a similar substance and painted white.  At the start of the game, the eggs are placed in the container, which in turn is placed in the Queen Ant's Nest in the middle of the board. The cubes are situated in their respective bases with the side showing the six ants uppermost. The die is thrown in turn, and the cubes moved the appropriate number of squares in the direction indicated, along the Base run and then up the Approach run.  The first player to reach his X on the Ant Nest surround, stops on that square and becomes the Defender of the Queen Ant's Nest. All other ants to reach their X's during that turn become Attackers, and attack the Defender. These attacks are resolved as follows: both players throw the die and the highest score wins, a draw counting as a win for the Defender. When the Defender wins, he remains where he is, and the Attacker returns to that square on his Approach run, having the same number as that thrown by the Defender. If the Attacker wins, he becomes the Defender, while the ousted Defender goes back to the square on his Base run having the same number as that thrown by the Attacker. Should a Defender be beaten by a throw of 6, he is returned to his Base and loses one ant from his group, and so recommences with the new ant group showing face up on the cube. A player with only one ant is knocked out of the game when beaten by an Attacker's throw of 6. On his turn, a Defender must attempt to circumnavigate the Nest, in accordance with throws of the die, and defend himself each time he lands on an opponent's X square containing a cube. When he returns to his own X, he stops (regardless of the throw) and is entitled to collect eggs as follows:  Size of     Ant Group 6-5 = 3 eggs 4-3 = 2 eggs 2-1 = 1 egg  Play continues until all the eggs have been removed from the nest. The initial number of eggs is optional, but an ideal number is 30. The winner is the player having most eggs at the end of the game.  Although it may sound complicated, 'Antheap' is in fact very simple to play. It is well worth going to the trouble of making the board and the cubes, for it will certainly provide the younger members of the family with hours of fun.",

Players control groups of 3 to 12 figures, controlling Heroes, Villains, Sidekicks, Henchmen, and many supporting characters. A game lasts typically 1 to 2 hours, and can be linked to other sessions in a campaign.  Each turn the players roll to determine who has Initiative.  Next, the characters that are still locked in Melee from the previous turn get to fight a round of combat or attempt to withdraw from the fight.  Then the main part of the turn begins. Players alternate activating Units. Models in an activating Unit check their cohesion. Models may be In Touch with one another or Out Of Touch. Models roll to determine if they will receive a Full or Partial Activation – models In Touch having a better chance to activate fully.  Models in the active Unit resolve their Full and\/or Partial Activation. They may walk, run, attack with ranged or melee weapons, get ready to fire, or take a defensive stance. Special Points can be spent to purchase special Benefits.  When a fight occurs, the attacking Model rolls a number of dice equal to the Impact value of their weapon. The number to meet or exceed to score a Hit is based on the character’s Ability. For each Hit inflicted, the target gets a Save roll based on their Protection value. Each unsaved Hit results in a Suppression or a Wound. Suppressions impair the target; Wounds get the character closer to be removed from the game.  After all Models in a Unit have resolved their Active and\/or Partial Activations, another Unit activates. Activations continue this way until all Units have acted. At that point tokens that do not apply anymore are removed from the play area, and a new turn is started.",

    "description":"Legacy of Glory is a set of rules for fighting tactical Napoleonic battles. The preferred figure scale is 1:60 and the ground scale is 1\" = 50 meters. Play is divided into 2-hour Grand Battle Turns, with each Grand Battle Turn subdivided into six tactical turns. Players normally take the role of army and corps commanders, and receive a variable number of command points each Grand Battle Turn, the actual number being determined by the talent rating of the historical general they're representing and the roll of two 10-sided dice. Commanders issue orders to the units under them, with each order requiring a different number of command points. Once an order is issued, there's some delay before it can be executed. The minimum delay depends on distance between the commander issuing the order and the most distant unit affected by it, and there's a variable number of tactical turns of additional delay, dependent on the quality of the generals involved and the roll of two ten-sided dice, before the order actually gets carried out. The smallest units on the board are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, but orders are issued only down to division (or elite brigade level).  Actions within a tactical turn are divided up into multiple phases, most of which are skipped in any particular turn because they don't apply (e.g., the infantry combat resolution phase is skipped if no infantry units are in melee this tactical turn). The designers state in the foreword that one of their objectives is that experienced players should be able to run wall-clock time and game time just about in synch--that is, a Grand Battle Turn should not take more than 2 hours to play, even at the hottest point in the battle.  The original rules came in a bookcase-sized box, and included a rulebook (with rating charts for units and generals, by nationality), three pages of combat charts, three sheets of thin board status markers, and a pair of different-colored 10-sided dice. An updated set of rules was supposed to be issued in 2000-2001, but appears to have fallen by the wayside. Some play test versions of the updated rules do exist.  These are NOT simple rules. They require a fair amount of knowledge of the Napoleonic period to play, since they reward historical formations and tactics and penalize certain forms of rule-lawyering. The ground scale requires a fair amount of playing area, enough that most historical battles could only be put on by a gaming club or run as a convention event.",

But dangers await in the dice you don't choose! You can hire townsfolk, buy wagons, pan for gold, and take on cattle — all the while preparing for inevitable raids, storms and famine. Who will best face the perils of the wild frontier and lead their wagon train to victory?  Pioneer Days is a dice-drafting game reminiscent of The Oregon Trail. While you pursue your strategy, you must be prepared for impending disasters such as storms, disease, raids, and famine.  Round by round, players draw dice out of the bag, roll them, then take turns drafting one to either collect silver, hire a townsfolk, or take an action based on the die value. Townsfolk confer immediate or constant benefits as well as end game scoring bonuses, while actions help you collect wood, medicine, cattle, equipment, and gold nuggets. The unchosen die each round advances one of the disaster tracks based on its color, and when a disaster gets to the end of its track, all players must deal with its effects:       During a raid, you lose half of your silver.     During a famine, you need to spend 1 silver per cattle or lose the cattle.     During a disease, you need 1 medicine per townsfolk or lose the townsfolk.     During a storm, you need 1 wood per wagon or suffer damage to your wagons.   At the end of each round, you can satisfy the current town's favor conditions in order to earn their favor.

A Proxy square means the active player chooses another player to answer for them; the active player advances on the correct answer, but the proxy goes back if they answer incorrectly.  A Blitz square allows everyone to answer as the active player reads the clues from most difficult to easiest.  As soon as someone answers correctly, they and the active player move ahead the number of squares matching the level of clue that was the question was answered on.

In game there are two types of tokens, one bicoloured for troops (civilian or military) and another one for credits (ingame cash). Each roud every player gets a new civilian troop and two credits per each civilian troop. Military troops do not have any economic advantage, they offer offensive an defensive advantages instead.  There is also a deck with 20 alien races to choose from, a game deck from which players extract resources to play with (technologies, fleet...) and a third deck called the System Deck. This one is of of upmost importance since it introduces both strategy and luck. Each round each player takes a System card from the deck which defines its position in the galaxy: depending on it he can commerce or make deals with other players, attack or be attacked. Once per round each player may jump to a new System and this may have various advantages: fleeing from a powerful enemy, pursuing a weak enemy and also, each time a player reaches a new system he may draw a card from the game deck. Even though luck is a factor, decision making is the heart of the game and may take you to supremacy or extinction.",

    "description":"Tixel is a combinatorial game for two players. The name comes from the playing pieces, which are basically pixels (squares) with a curved indentation on one of their edges. Tixels are \"directional\", meaning that their orientation is relevant.  On a turn, a player can either place a new tixel or move one of her own tixels already on the board. A tixel can be \"active\" or \"inactive\"; only active tixels, which are at a 45º angle, may be moved. Making tixels inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active tixel.  Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks three additional move types (aside from placing or moving a piece). If a tixel that is moved is made inactive at its end position — i.e., it's sacrificed — a player can take an extra move if she so chooses; aside from placing or moving a tixel, she can now remove a tixel from the board, activate an inactive tixel, or pivot an active tixel to reorient its hollow side.  Tixel: Expansion Pieces consists of four extra pieces for each player. These expansion pieces are different from regular pieces in that they are completely square instead of being hollow on one side. For each expansion piece used, remove one tixel from the game. The expansion pieces can be used to add variety to games, but they can also be used to handicap a stronger player. Simply give the stronger player more expansion pieces compared to the weaker player. With two expansion sets, the original Tix game can also be played on the Tixels board.",

During set-up, each player takes a set of tokens and two tiles, keeping them secret from other players; four tiles are turned face-up to form a communal pool.  On a turn, a player adds one or more tiles to the playing area from his personal area, the communal pool, or both locations. Each tile must be laid adjacent to at least one other tile in play, and the color of the tile must be next to the color of adjacent tiles on the color wheel. Thus, a green tile can be placed adjacent only to yellow or blue tiles, a red tile only next to orange and purple, and so on.  If a player completes a hexagon – dubbed a \"wheel\" – on his turn, he marks the center of the hexagon with a token. A \"full wheel\" with all six colors is worth three points, a bi-colored wheel worth two points, and all other wheels worth one point each. To end a turn, a player optionally refills his hand up to two tiles, then adds new tiles to the communal pool to fill it to four.  When all the tiles have been played, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. Vizia includes five variant rules for advanced play that can be mixed-and-matched as desired, such as scoring a bonus for a player's largest group of tokens, removing a token from play in order to move a tile already on the board, and reducing the number of communal tiles (which lessens luck of the draw).",

Governed by a circle of seers and a single Grand Alchemist, who wields boundless talent and protects the ancient secrets of the Greater Elemental Spirits, Crasis now seeks its next Grand Alchemist, who will be one of the few alchemists attempting to prove their abilities by synthesizing the legendary Crest of Creation.  This crest, a fabled mysticism documented to usher the golden age of alchemy and balance, can only be crafted by one skilled alchemist able to harness the five elements of earth, fire, water, air, and ether, using both natural and manufactured resources.  Take to the urban bazaars and elemental wilds of a land that is enriched by the power of alchemy blessed by the elements.  Players can look forward to managing organic resources as one of six characters to craft powerful items in a race to become the Grand Alchemist.  First, harvest the Foraging Fields to gather your base reagents and collect recipes used to craft items; then, alchemists will combine their base reagents to synthesize items from their recipes – all with usable effects aimed to both assist the creator and hinder competitors.   Players will ultimately quell everything at their disposal to create their own legendary Crest of Creation via a randomly generated recipe gained through playing, which will lead the most skilled alchemist to victory.

    "description":"The towers go up, the towers go down – that's the flow of the game in Ka-Boom, and whether you want the towers to stand or not depends on whether you're the master builder for the round or a saboteur aiming to cause destruction.  At the start of the game, players lay out the 26 tower tiles, with one large tile in the center of the playing area and the remaining tiles placed randomly around it. Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.  If an ammunition die lands with the \"Ka-Boom\" symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.  When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands. The next player in clockwise order then becomes the new master builder. As soon as a player reaches 16 points, the game ends and he wins!",

    "description":"The animals have escaped from the zoo, and it's up to the zookeepers to get everyone back in their cages — but lots of things can happen while you're chasing critters...  In Zooscape, originally released as Curio Collectors (ã¯ã‚“ã‹é€šéª¨è‘£å¸‚), you must prove yourself the best zookeeper by rounding up animals worth the most points, but remember that all the animals need enough space in their cage to stay happy! Shove too many in one cage, and they'll be worth almost nothing to you.  In each round, someone deals a line of twelve cards face up on the table; each card depicts an animal (a curio in the original version) along with a point value and a limit. The starting player splits the line in two by choosing a dividing point. Each player holds two cards showing the left or right group, and each player chooses, then simultaneously reveals which group of cards they want. If only one player chooses a side, they take all the cards in that group and add them to their personal tableau. If a side is chosen by more than one player, however, then one of the players who chose it splits that group into two smaller groups, then everyone who originally chose this group secretly votes again for which group they want. This process repeats with each group until either each player has taken some number of cards or groups have been reduced to single cards and two or more players are still voting to take them; in this case, those single cards are placed in a special pile. At the start of a round, the starting player adds a special card to the line-up and whoever wins this card collects all of the animals in this special pile.  Players complete three rounds this way, then score points. If a group of cards has exceeded the limit on it — say, by collecting four cards when the limit is three — then the owner of these cards scores only 1 point per card instead of the point value for each card. Some cards in the game allow you to remove cards from your collection, possibly allowing you to stay under the limit and score more points. You might also start trying not to win cards so as not to spoil the value of what you've already collected. (In Curio Collectors, you would effectively crash the market value for an item by trying to sell too many of them at one time.)  Whoever has the most points wins!",

Whenever all native influence is eliminated from a region, that region's resources are collected. The amount of resources collected by each player depends on each players' influence in the region.

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:  Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order  In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he\/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.  Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.  Players begin to form strings and\/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).  Phase 3: Players spend money\/camels on various investments.  A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.  The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.  In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.",

Hulo! is a fast, fun, and easy way to practice your Hawaiian vocabulary. Whether you know five Hawaiian words or five hundred, you can enjoy learning with friends and family as you race to complete your Hawaiian crossword.        Hulo! is themed after the old Hawaiian nupepa, or newspapers, which didn’t have diacritics. So you can play without worrying about okina and kahako markings.          Wondering if you can use people or place names? Hiki no! Go right ahead. So even if you don’t know many Hawaiian words, you probably know a lot of names of people, streets, cities, and other places.      Two-letter huaolelo are okay.      You can use the same word twice.      Going over the pronunciation and definitions at the end is one of the funnest parts of the game. See how many new huaolelo you can learn from the other players.      Instructions are included inside the box.   You'll find a few pieces that aren't letters.  Watch out for the Ewalu piece! If someone draws it and plays it on you, aue! Aloha no! That means your crossword has to have at least one eight-letter huaolelo. Laki maikai!  Need some different letters to spell a huaolelo? If you draw an Akau piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the akau, right.  If you draw a Hema piece, you can force all players to pass two pieces of their choosing to the hema, left.  The Ku! piece is like a wildcard, so you can use it as any letter of your choosing. Or, if someone is winning and you want to stop their momentum, yell out \"Ku!\" to stop gameplay. You can then take one of their letters, replace it with the Ku! piece, and designate the Ku! piece as a different letter. Ho ke kolohe! What this means for your opponent is probably a lot of crossword rearranging! Minamina no hoi!  The Ea piece is the one everybody wants to have. It means you have ea, or sovereignty, so nobody can mess with your crossword. In other words, you're free to make your own huaolelo without being affected by special pieces like Ewalu, Akau, Hema, and Ku. You are kuokoa--independent!\"",

Each monster is denoted by a leter and colour type that is referenced vs the opponents monster to determine one of three types of attacks that can be performed. Players attempt to outperform their opponent by playing enhancements to increase the power of the attack, evolve to a more potent form, or to even change the colour type to one more advantageous. Cards may also be played to weaken or devolve the opponent monsters. The monster ending the battle with the highest rating wins.  Each starter contains 34 cards and one gold embossed card and one special \"hologram\" card. Rules and battlemat are combined in a single mapfold sheet.

You are not the only captain on the horizon looking to make some quick fame escorting earthlings to the other planets. You will have to trade with the planets in order to upgrade your ship so you can fight off each other as well as the Plutonian Space Pirate threat.  • The object of \"8 Planets: Captains of the Solar System\" is to earn victory points by rescuing the people of Earth and delivering them to the other planets in our solar system. Each player has their own spaceship on which he may carry both Earthlings and cargo. Cargo is moved from one planet to another and the further the cargo travels, the more credits will be earned for delivering the cargo to the other planets. Players have the ability to upgrade their engines, expand their cargo space, and obtain more powerful weapons by using credits earned. Powerful engines allow players to travel a greater distance between planets, and they also affect turn order. Your cargo hold is small at first, but when you upgrade, you can hold greater amounts of cargo and refugees. Weapon strength helps you to defeat the Plutonian Space Pirates, who hide in the Main Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt. Strong weapons also help players defeat each other when they are engaged in player versus player combat.  • Players earn victory points both by delivering people to other planets and by defeating other players in player versus player combat. Players who are brave enough to travel to the Main Asteroid Belt or Kuiper Belt may earn additional victory points by defeating the Plutonian Space Pirates.  • When play begins, Earth has six years left before it will become uninhabitable. There are four rounds (seasons) of play in each year, preceded by the action of revealing one event card. Event cards affect each year of play by changing certain elements of the game. For example, an Galactic Event card may ban player versus player combat on any given planet for one year, or may cause cargo deliveries to be worth less or more than usual.  • Will you take the role of a reputable space trader, a sinister space pirate, or even a famous humanitarian who lives to save millions of lives? Earth needs your help!",

Four of the sections play very quickly (Initiative Determination, Diplomacy, Drawing Phase Chits, and determining if victory conditions have been met.  The fifth section, Phases, has 12 Actions.

The remaining six are displayed face down, providing some uncertainty as to the next Action to occur.  As there are 15 Action chits from which to choose, players never know exactly what will occur the second half of the Phase sections. Players must husband their resources and food to maintain their field armies, build and re-equip units, improve fortified cities, and wage battle.  Play is balanced, with each nation's victory conditions tailored to its historical situation. Game duration ranges from 3 hours for a two-player game up to 5-6 hours for a five-player game.",

As a hungry galaxy clamors for thin-crusted Italian delicacies, the little-understood, physics-defying Two Dimensional Drive has been employed to meet the need. By collapsing three-dimensional space down to a two-dimensional matrix, the 2D Drive makes it possible to cross vast distances in seconds. The catch? 2D ships can transport only flat cargo – which makes them perfect for pizza and not much else. (Possible caveat: Cosmic Pancakes.)  In this strange future, a daring pizza pioneer such as yourself can become rich beyond your wildest dreams – but only if you're willing to take on the risks of interstellar, two-dimensional flight. Perhaps the greatest challenge: Mastering the mind-bending reality that is two-dimensional space. Luckily for you, your ship has a tutorial mode.  Cosmic Pizza is a spatial reasoning game for 2-4 players in which players must master an ever-increasing array of dizzying maneuvers; it also boasts variable difficulty levels. If you're a hardcore puzzle fan, you can take on Space Crazy mode, while your kids zip along in the lighter Junior mode.",

    "description":"Over the 1982-1983 Christmas holiday, Demian Freeling's father, famed abstract game designer Christiaan Freeling, suggested to his then seven-year-old son that he should design a chess-like game using a seven-by-seven board and seven yet to be defined pawns on the second rank and a royal piece in the middle. Drawing on his own experience with Chess and Xiang-Qi, Demian came up with Congo in just over an hour's time. Games tend to be fairly quick and bloody.  Set on an African Savannah with a river running horizontally across the board, the central royal piece is, of course, a lion, and a player wins by capturing the opposing lion. Lions move by stepping one space in any direction, but (except to capture the opposing lion for the win, which it can do by facing the opposing lion on an open file) is confined to the three-by-three area in the middle of its side of the board.  Reading the initial setup across the first rank, there is a zebra that moves and captures like a Chess knight. Next is a crocodile that can move and capture by stepping one space in any direction or may race all the way to the river on an open file or may swim horizontally within the river along its entire unobstructed length. Next comes an elephant that moves and captures by jumping one or two squares orthogonally. Next is the lion, then another elephant. Next is a monkey that moves by stepping one space in any direction or captures (possibly repeatedly) by jumping over pieces by a short leap (i.e., the monkey's capturing movement is like the piece movement in Halma, but with immediate capture). Last comes the giraffe, which can jump one or two steps in any direction or capture by jumping onto pieces two spaces away in any direction. Like animals on opposing sides are lined up opposite their counterparts.  The second rank on each side is filled with un-promoted pawns that move and capture by stepping one space straight or diagonally forward, and may (but only from across the river) also retreat one or two spaces straight backward without capture. Pawns promote to a super-pawn upon reaching the last rank, and may additionally move and capture one space horizontally or retreat one or two spaces diagonally backward from any space on the board. Any piece except the crocodile may only stay in the river for one turn, after which it drowns if not moved further.",

    "description":"In Taking Food From Bears, each player takes the role of a hiker trying to take food from a bear  At the beginning of the game, each player receives a set of seven cards, with numbers from 1 to 5, 1 whistle, and 1 bear trap. The Bear cards have values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. In a round, players attempt to steal from the target bear by playing his cards in sequence. The first player secretly looks at the target bear (the top bear card) and plays one of his number cards face up. If he plays a \"3\" card, it means that the player intends to steal 3 food from the target bear. Next players have two options: 1) look at the bear card just as the first player did and play a number card face up; or 2) play a number\/whistle\/bear card face down, take a multiplier (x2) card from the pool, and put the multiplier card on his face down number card.  After all the players played their cards, the Bear card is revealed. Beginning from the player who played the lowest card, add up the value of the number tokens. Suppose that the Bear is \"9\" and Josh played \"3\", Becky \"5\", Lupita \"2\", and Samuel \"3\" with \"x2\" multiplier on it, Lupita (2), Josh (3), and Samuel (3) are entitled to receive 2, 3, and 6 (3x2) food respectively. However, Becky will receive a wound (worth -2 food at the end of the game), since she fought the bear and lost. 9 is bigger than 2+3+3 but it is smaller than 2+3+3+5. Becky triggered the Bear's wrath. Playing the Whistle card will startle the Bear and trigger each other player to be wounded, but the player playing the Whistle card will receive no food this round. Playing the Trap card will keep the player safe against being wounded, but the player playing the card will receive no food this round. The player that received the most amount of food the last round, going clockwise from the starting player, starts the next round.  Play continues in this manner for a specified number of rounds,or until all the food is depleted, or until one player receives 5 wounds. The player with the most food at the game end is the winner.",

    "description":"This is the kids version of the famous The Farming Game.  This game has three levels of play for harvesting your crops:        The first level is for kids ages 3-5.  It consists of rolling a red die (values 1-3) and moving the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  If you land on a type of produce, you get a matching card for it.  If they land on a school bus or playground, they get nothing.  The first player to reach the end stops the game.  All players count their cards and the one with the most wins.      The second level is for kids ages 5-7.  Again, you roll the red die to move, but instead of collecting produce cards when you land on a produce space, you roll a white die (values 1-6) and match it with a produce rate card to see how much money you sold that produce for.  You then get it in play money.  The first player to reach the end stops game play and all count their money.  The one with the most money wins.      The third level is for kids ages 7-9.  This combines the aspects of levels 1 and 2 and adds additional complexity.  When you land on a produce space, you get the matching produce card.  You can then roll the white die to sell the produce, or keep the card.  If you keep it, the next time you land on that produce space, you get another card.  You then have two of a kind.  If you want to sell them, roll the white die, consult the rate chart, and sell all of your cards of that produce.  The one who makes it to the end, stops the gameplay and the one who has the most money wins.  You can also trade cards with other players before the red move die is rolled.   This game has a colorful board and easy-to-read rate charts and money. Even parents can find amusement with this game.  Re-implements:      The Farming Game",

    "name":"Rat Hot",
    "description":"Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.   Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.  All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.  The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.  The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.  When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.  The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.  Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.  Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.",

    "name":"Mr. President",
    "description":"Mr. President is a solitaire game about governing as the President of the United States. It's not an election game. It begins after you've been elected. It's about sitting in The Chair and trying to advance your agenda while navigating ongoing crises, political enemies, public opinion, your relations with Congress and the press, and keeping your country secure in a world of rival nations and agendas that just seems to keep blowing up around you. Mr. President is a resource management game, where you never have enough resources to achieve your entire agenda, and the path you take through an always unpredictable storyline rests on the choices you make. Depending on the results of those choices, and on the unfolding of a \"different every game\" story, you'll either be thinking \"POTUS? Piece of Cake!\" or \"Why was it that I WANTED this job?\" many times in each game.  Like the actual President, you'll have an array of allies and resources to help you as you navigate both the corridors of power in the nation's capital and the uncertainties of international relations. These allies and resources will vary from game to game, but you'll always be able to rely on your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to help you with foreign policy and with the use, where you deem necessary, of the combat power of the U.S. military. You'll also have a bevy of domestic advisors and friends in Congress to help you navigate the many challenges in Congress and domestic life and politics. And you'll always have access to at least one truly exceptional talent (this, too, will vary from game to game), someone who excels in their particular job and is a \"force multiplier\" for you in their own unique way. How you lead and utilize this mix of talents and experience at your disposal will go a long way toward determining your success or failure during your shot at being Mr. President.  Game Play  The Map. The game map allows you to see and track the domestic and world situation that the game creates. It is divided into sections:  1. Congress. This is where you track progress of legislation, as well as keep track of your friends and opponents in Congress.  2. Advisors and Assets. This section of the map is a holding area for all of your advisors, available action points, and military assets.  3. Crisis Management. This is where you manage the Crisis Cards and keep track of crisis status and how well you've dealt with each crisis.  4. The World portion of the map (about half of the map) is divided into eight world regions, with additional sections for Russia and China (your key potential antagonists in the game). Here's a look at the South America Region, as an example of the regional displays:  Crisis Cards. At the heart of Mr. President are the 150+ Crisis Cards that help create the storyline for each game. These cards - see the 12 sample cards on this page - are a mix of cards representing Domestic or World Crises, Terrorism Events, Unexpected Benefits, and Opportunities. The Crisis Cards help drive, but do not completely control, the storyline in each game. Here's how it works:  Each game of Mr. President is divided into eight turns, each representing six months in office. These turns are further divided into six Rounds, each representing one month.  At the start of each turn, you get to perform assessment and planning actions, where you get to lay out your rough plan, re-examine strategy, re-evaluate the threats and opportunities that were presenting as the previous turn ended (or at game start). So there is definitely a proactive strategy piece to the game. Unfortunately, though, your plans are not often going to survive intact once the turn gets going. The world stage is a dynamic platform.  Once you have your plans made (and the Mr. President gods laugh at you!), you perform the six monthly rounds in order. During each round, you draw three Crisis Cards that represent that main world or domestic events that happen (these are usually bad from your point of view, but occasionally they are events or resources that help you) during that month. Most of the events on the Crisis Cards present you with both an urgent problem that may immediately alter the board state, and a longer term issue that may linger and cause you pain down the road if you don't address it well.  After you flip and resolve the three Crisis Cards for the round, you get to take actions, using any of your available personnel and resources. These actions allow you  to make progress on your legislative agenda, attempt to address any new crises presented by the round's three actions cards, deal with any lingering world or domestic issues, fight terrorism, perform diplomacy, and attempt to better your situation in the world or in the eyes of the American people.  Once you finish your action portion of the round, that round (month) is finished, and you move on to the next round, drawing three new Crisis Cards and repeating the round process until the 6-month turn is complete.  Seeded within the 18-card mix that makes up a turn, you have six cards for Russian and Chinese Actions, Terror Actions, War Progress, Crisis Checks, and White House Life. You know that each of these six cards will show up sometime during each turn, but you don't know when. The variable timing of these cards' appearance each turn adds uncertainty and spice to the game, while ensuring that major players in the game present challenges for you every single turn. Russia and China offer deeper challenges, with four possible postures (aggression levels) for each country and a country-specific AI for each. Postures may shift in-game in response to your actions or to storyline events, making dealing positively with each nation an evolving challenge all game.  Please note that Mr. President is NOT a \"beer and pretzels\" surface-level game. This game is intended to be deep and immersive, one that will both frustrate and delight the solitaire player. Playing time is four to eight hours (depending on your experience level) to play an entire 4-year term. I've tried to pack as much fun as possible into each 6-month turn, so that even if you only have time to play one turn on a weeknight, you'll be engaged, frustrated, challenged, and immersed throughout. That said, I hope you're going to find it difficult to stop playing after each turn. I've designed Mr. President to be an experience that will wrap you up in each new game's story, and beckon you back to the game table after each round, turn, or completed game.  I designed this game to provide massive replayability. With over 150 Crisis cards in the mix, and multiple subsystems representing the US Economy, Congress, Homeland Security, the Press, Presidential Prestige, Russia, China, Hostile Rogue States, and staunch Allies, no two games of Mr. President will ever play remotely alike. If you think you're ready for that challenge, go ahead. Raise your right hand and swear the oath. Then settle in behind the desk in the Oval Office, and let your imagination run wild!  I hope playing Mr. President brings you as much enjoyment as designing it has brought me!  - Gene  Components  22 x 34” mounted game board 165 Cards 600 counters and markers       rulebook  playbook six card stock player aid cards one ten-sided and two six-sided dice",

The game includes two volumes, the Rulebook and the Army Lists, as well as character figures for the Orc\/British leader and the Elf\/French leader, as well as dice and command cards needed for play.  You will need to put together your armies from the fantasy Napoleonic line produced by Alternative Armies for this and Flintloque\/Deadloque.  While I bought it to play the game, I found it was very handy for Flintloque players as it contains a much more complete background on the world of Valon, as well as details on the uniforms of the different armies and races of the fantasy world.  Lots of photographs in color and black & white give the player lots of details to help paint their units.  There is also a sample game with color photographs showing each phase and turn of a game to demonstrate the rules in action over a period of three turns.  The game recommends minimum units of divisions, made up of an average of 3 infantry units (around 20 figures each), one cavalry unit (of around 10 figures) and one artillery unit (one or two guns with crews, limbers, etc.), but suggests that each player can control a corps of 2 divisions.  I believe that you could play to learn the rules with just 2 or 3 units as you build your armies.  There is some player-to-player and distributer-to-player support available on an associated Yahoo group.  Description is based on the 2nd edition.",

Players take control of the cities of Athens and Sparta and train soldiers, construct buildings, capture cities, and engage in epic battles for the future of Greece. Players control their empire from a full campaign perspective on the game board, but once a battle begins, players can command their soldiers in tactical, unit-by-unit combat on separate battlefield maps.  Game turns are divided into the four seasons of the year. Each season has four phases in which players: 1) Build up their empire by recruiting units, constructing buildings and conducting diplomacy. 2) Move their units around the Campaign Map and besiege cities. 3) Engage in battle and command their soldiers in tactical, simulation combat. 4) Protect themselves against revolts of the people and the stormy seas of the Aegean.  Every triumph brings your city more glory, and closer to victory, until all Greece kneels before you. Throughout the game players earn things called Glory Points for doing things like capturing cities, winning battles – even just by proving that your enemy is too cowardly to come out and fight. Whichever player is the first to get to 75 Glory Points wins the game.",

Included are 4 dragster Control Consoles, 88 play cards, 80+ counters, the track, dice, and four custom miniatures representing the dragsters.  This game plays a bit like \"Robo Rally lite,\" with players selecting cards in secret and arranging them in the order they are to be revealed to determine their dragsters' movement for the turn. The number of cards, from 1 to 3, each player selects, and when they are revealed, depends on the speed of his\/her dragster, which generally increases from the start line. As dragsters collide with each other, they are knocked off course, and may rebound from the \"walls\" of the track. Each dragster has a supply of mines and missiles, as well as a certain amount of power for shields to deflect hits. Before the race starts, each player customizes his\/her dragster with one secret piece of equipment which confers a special ability.  The winner is either the player to cross the finish line first, or the only player to survive the battling for position along the way.  This demo game was produced in a set of 150 and distributed at conventions to test the waters for a full-size Great Space Race game in the future.  Re-implemented as:      The Great Space Race",

Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring well-known items, crafts and animals and chooses some of them. Each player's cards and shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.  In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many words and phrases on the cards as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!  Time's Up! Family 2 has 440 new words.",

    "description":"Description from the designer: One-Minute Bulge is a solitaire challenge. The entire campaign only takes about 60 seconds to play so One-Minute Bulge is obviously a short game. However, it offers the player most of the strategic choices available to the German military commanders in 1944. The player represents a group of high-ranking officers like von Rundstedt, Model, Dietrich, and von Manteuffel. Historical factors like weather, supply, the Westwall defenses, and the dreaded Fuhrer Conference are included in the rules.  This little simulation attempts to create a narrative and it does an adequate job for a game with a short duration. The player will need a combination of good luck and bad weather to seize the crucial port of Antwerp for the Fuhrer. In 1944 Feldmarschall Model said the chances for a successful attack were only 1 in 10. In a typical One-Minute Bulge  session the player has slightly better odds.  One-Minute Bulge is a free Print & Play game with a single 8.5\" x 11\" map, seven playing pieces, a couple of charts, and a few markers.

Now, a spinner is spun, determining the special conditions for this round: it may be a straightforward race, or there may be special conditions, such as the players being required to run backwards or to spin twice before delivering the egg.  If a player drops his egg, he is out of the race for that round. If both players succesfully deliver their eggs, the fastest player's team receives an additional egg.  The game continues until fewer than three undelivered eggs remain at the beginning of a round. Now, players inspect their eggs by flipping them over to see which ones \"hatch\".

The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:        A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;      Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;      And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.   Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it. or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).  Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.  The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.  This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the \"expandable\" board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other \"episodes\"!",

    "description":"\"FQ3\" is a board game that recreates the world of the car races. With a mixture of strategy, action, control of risk, and some touches of role, FQ3 represents a real way (and funny too), all that happens inside and outside of the tracks.  \"FQ3\" has 3 difficulty levels of rules to satisfy all kind of players;  - BASIC RULES: Aimed at casual and undemanding gamers.  - ADVANCED RULES: For fans of race games. These rules are more realistic, and involved all sorts of factors: such as types of tires, fuel loads, setting the car, kers, yellow flag, Safety Car, moral of drivers and injuries, etc.  - MANAGER MODE: Only for those who  drink gasoline! In this game mode, in addition to the role of pilot, you will assume the role of team manager. You will manage the economy, hiring drivers, sponsors, engineers, desing the car and evolve it. The years pass and drivers will gain experience and they will improve their skills.  SUMMARY OF GAMEPLAY: The Friday of the GP, the player must decide the strategy (number of stops, tires, and fuel load).  On Saturday, will be held the pole position, it follows a mathematical operation involving various modifiers (skills of the pilot, car performance, fuel load, tires, moral, blunders, and a roll of 1d20).  The race takes place the Sunday. The circuit is composed of squares. The cars will go moving by circuit as many squares as the speed (gear dependent) of your car. When the cars reach the corners, the drivers must brake and accelerate. Brakes and accelerates with a d100. Drivers have an ability to Brake and Accelerate that used to take curves (higher or lower depending on driver). These skills will be modified by the fuel load, tire types, and how close you decide to brake and accelerate. The risk you take in the curves is important; you can take away your opponents, but be careful!, fail brake roll or acceleration roll will damage your car.  The game stands on four pillars: The driver, the car, the pit stop mechanics, and the circuit. Each of them has many different skills, qualities or details that make it different from the others.  This is a brief summary of how to play. There are many and funny rules, such as kers, spin, overtaking, blunders, drivers' virtues, drive's defects, safety car,etc.",

Operation Typhoon: Barbarossa Denied is a simple 2 player game that reflects Army Group Center’s drive to Moscow in the fateful months from Sept. to Dec. 1941. The last ditch efforts by the German Army to bring the War in the East to a conclusion before Christmas. They failed!  Units may move and attack all adjacent units at the end of movement. After resolving combat, units that remain adjacent to enemy units may attack again. Stuka counter increases odds column by 1. Units have 1 side step reduction. Object of the game is to take cities and kill enemy units. Points are awarded for both. Weather in Operation Typhoon is handled in a very interesting way.

    "description":"The Battle of Nations - 14-19 October, 1813  Napoleonic 20 #16 (Germany 20 #7)  What began at the Battle of Dresden and continued to unfold on battlefieds across the German States including Kulm, Dennewitz, Grossbeeren, Gorlitz, and the Katzbach River, have all led up to this. Four Allied nations, and their four armies are converging on Napoleon’s Grande Armée as it falls back to its supply base at Leipzig. More than a half-million soldiers will stand and face eather other over these fateful days, which are now yours to command in this epic installment of VPG's venerable Napoleonic 20 series. The Battle of Nations awaits!  Featuring a strategic scale with corps-sized units and mult-hour game turns, play moves smartly across this, the largest single game map in this series. Helping to tell the narrative of this great battle are new types of Event cards and the inclusion of Strategy cards allowing players to choose their pre-battle disposition and set their overall plan. This tense-and-ever-growing meeting engagement will require skill and strategic sense to master.  Innovations to this game series include the addition of Leader units, whose command span shows the limits of leadership over such a sprawling battlefield. Also, to show the prolonged effects of keeping troops committed to battle, a simple Fatigue system has been added to keep players thinking about reasting their weary forces over the multiple days of the fighting.  Game Data:  Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale Solitaire Suitability: 4 on a 9 scale Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 1000 meters, and each turn is roughly 3.5 day hours (or 10 night hours).

    "name":"Polemos: Franco-Prussian War",
    "description":"POLEMOS - FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR  When Emperor Louis Napoleon declared war on Prussia in Summer 1870 he was at the head of an army that most contemporaries regarded as the leading military force in Europe. No doubt he had plans of recreating the Glory of his illustrious namesake Uncle. What actually happened was a campaign that saw the Prussians invading France and the Imperial army capitulating at Sedan. Louis Napoleon abdicated and the French carried in the war under the auspices of the Third Republic.  As a wargames period, the FPW remains largely unexplored. There seems to be a general myth that the uniforms are boring, the battles one-sided and that information is just too hard to get to those of whose language skills do not include French and German. As it happens, nothing could be further than the truth than these stereotypes. The French can have a large variety of brightly dressed and colourful units, ranging from the Imperial Guard to the Zouaves and the North African Turcos. You can even field the French Foreign Legion! The Prussians number a significant contingent of allied German troops who all add their own colour and variety to the army, especially the large contingent of Bavarians. Infantry battalions still fought carrying their colours into action and the deployed armies make a brave show on the wargames table. The Prussians may have their superb artillery arm, but the French Infantry were armed with the Chassepot rifle. Tactics were in state of flux as armies were coming to terms with the change from Napoleonic tactics to ones more suited to the greater range and lethality of rifles and artillery. No greater example of this can be seen than the presence of Cavalry units whose purpose was still to charge the enemy with cold steel as their fathers and grandfathers had done.  If you've not considered 1870 before then it is well worth a second look!  Although the war involved unprecedented numbers of soldiers, there was a great deal of variety in the size of the battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.  Polemos FPW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, Commandant de Battaile will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Kommandant der Armee will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.  The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.  Polemos FPW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.  [u]Basing and Representation[\/u]: The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos FPW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.  [u]In Commandant de Battaile[\/u]: A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 500-1000 men.  A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment or three to four squadrons.  A 30mm x 30mm artillery or mitrailleuse base represents two batteries each of 6 guns. A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders  [u]In Kommandant der Armee[\/u]: 60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two CDB bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach. A 60mm square base of infantry represents a brigade or division of 1500 to 3000 men.  A 60mm square base of cavalry represents a brigade or division of 750 to 1500 men.  A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 18 to 36 guns,  All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW. This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.",

At beginning of the game, each player has 200 coins and the same deck of five cabbage cards, each of which is numbered -30, -20, -10, +10, or +20, indicating the quality of the cabbage.  Each round, players take a random cabbage card from the deck, and place it on the table face-down. Only the player who placed the card may look at its face value. Then they bid for the right to appraise opponents' cabbages.  The appraiser (highest bidder) may reveal an opponent's card. If its value is negative, the appraiser takes that many coins from that opponent as a fine for distributing bad cabbages. If positive, the appraiser must pay the opponent that many. The appraiser may repeat revealing until +20 is revealed or they wish to stop.  After the tenth round, when the deck runs out twice, the player with the most coins win the game.

    "description":"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.  The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).  The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.  On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:  1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly \"herd\" a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.  Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.  The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his\/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.",

What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight\/control and the artwork on the cards.  The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.  There are six basic types of cards.  Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.  Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.  Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.  Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.  Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.  Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.  To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.  The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES\/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork. Kudos to Rick Berry, the graphic designer, for making one of the most striking looking games out there.",

They operated out of a swank office at the Hawaiian Village Hotel, where they were also the house detectives.

Then—by your grace—the world will be filled with life; be it by brawn or brain, your creations will vie for dominance. Fanged monstrosities, indomitable swordsmen, educated scholars, suave traders... Anything you can imagine, you may create; the Challenge will support their method of battle with a single system of resolution.  The Challenge is between two Creators, each with uniform tools at their disposal. Play is divided into two Phases: In Phase I, Creators alternate playing Tiled Cards to create a map, and use octagonal Origin Points to set where their Creations spawn from. In Phase II, Body & Soul Cards are paired together to make 3 Creations per team. After their Creator describes them, pawns are placed on the map to represent them. As pawns are moved around the map, they will come into conflict with Rival Creations. Conflict is resolved by rolling 1 to 3 six-sided dice. A continually exchanged Event Card assigned to each Creation provides aid or presents challenges as the game unfolds, typically by modifying the number of dice rolled.  By rolling successfully, Creations will lose Heart. When Heart is reduced to zero, the Creations is removed from the map. Origin Points have no Heart and are removed from the map when rolled against successfully, but are much harder to succeed against. The game is over when one side has lost both Origin Points or all 3 Creations. That side loses.",

    "name":"Conan",
    "description":"Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest\/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.  Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps — Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. — and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.  At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.  During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend \"gems\" from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their \"spent\" pool box to their \"available\" pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.  The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).  In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective — but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.  Components (according to the back of the box):       16 spell cards (in either English or French)      39 equipment cards (in either English or French)      60 tiles (actually 75, see below)      161 tokens      8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)      4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)      1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)      1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)      1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)      2 map boards      15 dice      75 \"gems\" (blue and red)      25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)      106 miniatures (plastic)      1 Overlord board (plastic)     The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). A functional set of tiles is thus 62 strong, the remaining 27 tiles being set aside. This is probably an artefact of the printing, with one sheet of tiles being bilingual and the remaining two uni-lingual.",

No dice are required, the game is driven only FAC (free action cards). The cards manage the 4 phases of a ski jump: in-run, lift-off, flight and landing. In each jump each jumper receives also the 5 marks of Judges and the correct wind correction. Both of this are driven by FAC.  A display sheet included in the game components helps to drive each phase of jump.  The game includes a card for several jumpers. In each jumper card are printed information about statistical lenght of jump, rank, medium mark, nationality and so on.  It's possible to recreate an entire World cup of this discipline or other venues or a tournament between players using a team of jumpers from different nations  For each event a jump sheet is used to write all information about each jump and mark. Copy on sheet the event, date and k point of the facility used, then the name of jumpers.  Sort jumper cards marked and turn several FAC for each jump.  After calculate by FAC the lenght of jump, points are gained, like in the official rules of FIS (Ski jump federation) by the lenght of jump, correction of wind (tail or head) and marks of judges. A temporary standings is formed after the first jump.  Only the 30th better ski jumpers cards can make the final jump.  Sum the points for the first and second jump and an official standing is formed for each event.",

Game Overview:  Players are dealt five ingredient cards, which are laid face up in front of them.  The top recipe card is turned over and then players draw cards to improve their ingredients to match the recipe.  If a card is kept, another card is discarded, so that players only have five cards at a time.  Players may draw from the discard pile as well.  The first player to match the exact number of ingredients to the recipe shouts \"Guacamole!\" and then wins that recipe card.  The game continues until one player has won one each of the Mild, Medium and Spicy recipe cards.  The game can either be played by turns or by \"scramble\" (where all players draw and discard as fast as they can at the same time).  There are three special cards to spice things up: Limes - all players pass a card to their left; Salsa Bowl - all players pass a card to their right; Sombrero - all players get up and move one chair to the left, taking over another player's hand.",

Each turn, each player receives two Magical Energy. Then, two Adventure cards are drawn. Each player sends his mage to one of these cards, or passes (which will give him an additional Energy).  After all players have allocated their mages, the Adventure cards are resolved. There are four types of card:      Magic Spell: This spell is auctioned off between the mages who were sent to this card. It is paid for in Energy, and it can be used to get more energy or victory points.     Orb: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of Energy.     Holy Site: Each mage who was sent here gets a certain amount of victory points and a random Artifact card.     Monster: The monster card is auctioned off the mages who were sent to this card. The player that wins it, defeats the monster and gets an amount of Magical Energy and\/or victory points. The players may also decide to skip the auction and cooperate to defeat the monster, which will yield less reward.     After the Adventures have been resolved, players may trade and play Artifacts (some Artifacts are only useful in pairs). Played Artifacts will give Magical Energy and\/or victory points.

The football is a counter, which at the beginning of the game is placed on square 14 for the kick-off. The two players, or sides — “Rovers” and “United” — throw the dice alternately. Rovers add the value of their throw to the number of the square on which the ball lies, and move it on to the square indicated; thus, if the ball is on 17 and they throw a 4, the ball is moved to 21. United subtract the value of their throw from the number where the ball previously was: thus if it is on 8 and they throw 3, the ball goes to 5. A goal is scored when the ball enters square 1 or square 27.  After a goal has been scored, the game is restarted, and the side which has lost the goal kicks off. If a throw leads to a number over 27 or less than 1, it is a goal lick, and the other side places the ball on the square in front of goal, and throws. If 1 is thrown while the ball is in a touch-line square, the ball is out of play and not moved, the other side taking a throw immediately.

Two new powers - the United States and Japan - were entering the world stage, even as many in the old guard began to creak under the weight of their own might. Communism, in the person of Vladimir Ilych Lenin, had begun to rear its head in Czarist Russia. Technology and the industrial revolution were changing everything, including the weapons of war. And while the \"Boxer Rebellion\" in China was easily quashed, the incident demonstrated growing resentment of European dominance.  Starmada: Iron Stars reveals a world in crisis. Recovery from the Martian Invasion is slow, and its effects will be felt for decades to come. Hopes that the extraterrestrial threat would result in a new spirit of cooperation and coexistence have been quickly dashed, with the Great Powers scrambling to take advantage of technological tidbits left behind by the invaders. While recent conflicts have been thankfully limited in scope, it seems only a matter of time before Humanity is engulfed in a new conflagration, this one of its own making.  This supplement is a unique \"crossover\" project, combining two of our most popular gaming systems. The intent is to introduce fans of the Iron Stars universe to the Universal Game of Starship Combat, while at the same time exposing those Starmada players who may have been reluctant to jump into a different environment a glimpse at an alternate Earth in which the Martian Invasion really happened.  Outside of the thrills of Edwardian space combat, there is plenty in these pages to expand any Starmada setting, including new options like:  * Faceted shielding     * Crew-killer weapons     * Etheric movement     * Critical damage  And more!  Starmada: Iron Stars is not a stand-alone product; ownership of the Starmada: The Admiralty Edition Core Rulebook is required.",

    "description":"Combat Commander: Battle Pack #5 – Fall of the West is the fifth themed collection of scenarios for use with the Combat Commander series of games. The theme of this Battle Pack shifts to actions in France, Belgium and Norway from late April to June 1940, looking at critical moments in this brief span where the forces of both sides tested each other sorely. To reflect this, the scenario special rules are designed to make the Allied Minor hand exhibit flexibility (which was demonstrated whenever higher echelon interference was reduced). CC–Fall of the West features twelve new scenarios printed on cardstock as well as ten new maps.  Special experimental AFV Rules are featured in four of the scenarios where tanks are facing infantry in settings that reveal how the doctrines, armaments and countermeasures were still early in development. While unfettered races by companies of tanks across the countryside remain a landmark image of the blitzkrieg, we found many instances of a more tentative level of engagement, suitable for our attempt at capturing an unusual element in the CC scope – TANKS!  The new maps depict specific locations in France, Belgium and Norway, which have been located and specifically verified (from the sky, maps and in texts). The player will discover the actual names of roads and other terrain features as a reminder of the reality of the events.  The scenarios included in CC–Fall of the West are:   74 – “Sturmgruppe Granit” starts with the daring glider landings on top of Fort Eben Emael and serves as the opening to the Fall of the West, 10 May 1940; 75 – “Sturmgruppe Beton” set near Maastricht, Belgium with another element of the glider landings facing fierce counterattack by Belgian forces , 10 May 1940; 76 – “A Most Gallant Dirty Little Imp”, set at the Dyle River, Belgium, featuring heroic leadership by the first winner of the Victoria Cross in WW2, 15 May 1940; 77 – “The Crucible of Fire” set at Petegem, Belgium, during the early tactical withdrawal of the BEF – features the Bren Carrier, 21 May 1940; 78 – “By These Deeds They Shall Be Known” set in Cassel, France during the desperate rearguard work by the BEF to protect the Port of Dunkirk, 27 May 1940; 79 – “Battering Ram at Kvam” set in the Gudbrandsdal Valley in Norway with valiant British defenders facing heavy German assault by tanks and bombers, 26 April 1940; 80 – “Bitter Isthmus” set at the French frontier town of Monthermé, showing that locally the French were equal to the test set before them, 14 May 1940; 81 – “The Bottleneck” set near Sedan, France in a fluid seesaw moment during the swift German advance – features the FCM 36, 14 May 1940; 82 – “Hidden Guns Lash Out” set at the outskirts of Gembloux, France, where defiant, capable defenders held off a major German assault – features the PzKfw III, 14 June 1940; 83 – “Thrust in the Dust” covers the zenith of the heroic French anti-tank defense of Gembloux, facing waves of German armor, 15 June 1940; 84 – “Seize the Canal” set at Château-Porcien, France on the River Aisne, with a heavy urban assault by German forces seeking to breech the river line, 9 June 1940; 85 – “The Striking Hammer” features a  major armored counterattack against the German-held positions at Perthes, France – features the Char B1bis, 10 June 1940;    NOTE: CC–Fall of the West is not a complete game and requires ownership of Combat Commander: Europe and Combat Commander: Mediterranean to play.

This 128-page sourcebook contains an historical overview of the period and covers events from 527 to 1204 A.D. During this period we see the rise of importance of the cavalryman on the field of battle and this book reflects that development as Byzantium repeatedly struggled and triumphed.  Featured within this book are detailed army lists including:        Early Byzantines 527-660 AD - including the armies of Justinian and Heraclius.       Germanic Kingdoms 442-800 AD - including the armies of the Ostrogoths and Lombards.       Sassanid Persians 226-649 AD - including armies for the early and later Sassanid period.       Steppe Nomads 558-1200 AD - including the armies of the Magyars and Penchenegs.       Thematic Byzantines 660- 1042 AD - including the armies of the Isaurian and Macedonian dynasties.       Bulgars and Slavs 643- 1018 AD - including the armies of the early and later Bulgars.       Early Caliphates 632- 1073 AD - including the armies of the Arab Conquest and Abbasids.       The Rus 750-1250 AD - including the armies of the Early Pagan and Great Rus.       Later Byzantines1042-1185 AD - including the armies of the Komnenian dynasty.    Using these 9 lists and appendixes you can create over 35 different variations of armies from the Byzantine period. Also included are some Orders of Battle for some famous encounters from the period including:        The Battle of Dara 530 AD.       The Battle of Yarmuk 636 AD.       The Battle of Dorostolon 971 AD.      The Battle of Manizkert 1071 AD.    The book also contains a 16-page full-color section portraying the armies of the time and a wealth of illustrations and color maps.",

An answer can be given only once throughout that round.  The round ends when one player has given answer for each card from his hand. Then he scores a point.  A player must take an additional card, if He does not have words or he is too slow.  After several rounds the player with the most points wins.",

Even as the different affiliations of Star Wars: The Card Game explore the possibilities offered by the \"Echoes of the Force\" cycle, you may discover that the best way to gain control of the Force struggle is a targeted offense that directly attacks your opponent's Force-committed units. To that end, It Binds All Things also introduces one of the galaxy's most feared Bounty Hunters, the Assassin Droid IG-88.  The Force holds the galaxy of Star Wars together and developing your devotion to the Force may determine the outcome of your future games!",

Events and operations represent a variety of ephemeral processes that occur both in the meat world and the virtual one. When they hit the discard pile, do their impacts just disappear? Or if they transmit signals into space, might their echoes ever linger, gain a sort of permanence in their repetition, and impact future events?  The sixty new cards from The Spaces Between (three copies each of twenty different cards), re-examine the essential natures of the game's events and operations, and every faction gains a new current, an event or operation that isn't immediately resolved and discarded after it's played, but continues to reside in the data streams somewhere between a state of transience and a state of permanence.",

I see, now, that this was wrong: A fog is made all of the same stuff, but our doom has many distinct facets, each one we penetrate revealing a new evil behind. Some have become terrified of the darkness; others made numb by despair. Many have had their bodies rent, while others are starting to lose their minds. A scout has just sent word of another new variety of monstrosity that has appeared near the village...but also the discovery of a new artifact that may help us fight them.  Fate, it seems, never runs out of ideas. We can only handle each new challenge as best we can as it arrives on shifting winds...  Darkest Night: On Shifting Winds from Jeremy Lennert expands the game with a variety of new content: It adds the Ranger, Scout, Wayfarer, and Wind Dancer as new playable heroes, introduces eight new blights and new treasures to search for, and also includes new Event and Artifact cards.  On Shifting Winds can be used either with or without the first expansion, With an Inner Light.  Note: This game requires that you (or someone in your group of players) own a copy of Darkest Night.

With three new options to add to your game, Exodus is a great way to expand on the accusations and mistrust that runs rampant in Battlestar Galactica.  You can choose to add any combination of the three new options included in Exodus. Crave more white-knuckle space dog-fighting? Incorporate the Cylon Fleet option. The Conflicted Loyalties option introduces new Loyalty Cards that will test even the most trustworthy allegiances. Finally, relive the emotional turmoil of the hit television series with the Ionian Nebula, which pits players against the various conflicting personalities aboard Galactica.  The Cylon Fleet option keeps the pressure intense by introducing the Cylon Fleet game board. This board makes sure that every Crisis Card drawn will result in some sort of enemy ship activity. Once the Cylon Pursuit Track reaches the end, the Cylon ships will transfer over to the main game board, surrounding Galactica. There’s little time for rest between assaults, so get out there and protect those civvies, fighter jockeys!  Alliances are put to the test in the Conflicted Loyalties option, where the new Final Five Loyalty Cards up the stakes and introduce penalties for revealing your fellow humans’ Loyalty Card. In addition, new Personal Goal Loyalty Cards present players with an incriminating task to undertake. If they don’t fulfill their goal, then they will cause Galactica to lose a resource at the end of the game. Will you raise suspicion by completing the damaging task, or will you lay low and hope your failures won’t condemn the rest of your crew?  Finally, with the Ionian Nebula option, familiar faces populate the fleet as allies, and can be encountered by visiting locations on Galactica. But beware! The Cylons can influence these non-player characters, compelling them to produce negative effects when encountered. Manage humanity’s conflicting personalities carefully... or infighting will leave you vulnerable!",

This expansion is easy to print (just one page) and use all the basic rules of Tikal.  It transforms the peaceful exploration in a bloody B movie.",

    "description":"This is Lone Canuck's third scenario pack of Canadian actions in WW II Italy.  It contains 10 scenario cards.  Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:  31 August 1944... The Royal 22nd Regiment moved into action before dawn in a bid to secure the right shoulder of the breach in the Gothic Line. Engineers worked through the night to clear three narrow paths in the minefield where the West Novas had earlier come to grief, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Allard hurried two companies forward.  1 September 1944... In the centre, the Fifth Division had not been idle. Monte Peloso and Tomba di Pesaro were its primary objectives, but it took most of the day to complete their capture. The original plan called for the Perths and Strathconas to attack Peloso, but this had to be revised when it became apparent that fresh infantry would be needed.   15 September 1944... Eighth Army designated the Canadian Corps as its pursuit corps and placed the British 4th and 2nd New Zealand divisions, the British 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. The Canadian Corps was to launch its assault as soon as the rains stopped.   18 September 1944... The situation on the First Canadian Division’s front was not so happy. Unlike the British V Corps, the Canadian First Division commander Chris Vokes was unable to offer assurances about getting over the Ausa on the 18th and nothing could be done until San Martino had been recaptured and the first had moved up to the Rimini railway line. Finesse had not worked thus far, thus the Vokes decided to try brute force.   23 September 1944... Intent on debouching into the broad valley of the Po, the First Canadian Corps poured troops and tanks through the Marecchia bridgehead. General Burns had designated three successive rivers as the main objectives of the coming operations, the Fiumicino, the Savio, and the Ronco, twenty-five miles beyond the Marecchia.   5 December 1944... The First Division was having problems. Despite committing it’s reserve unit, the Carleton and York Regiment, the Third Brigade was unable to get beyond the Lamone. By the morning of 4 December, 48-hours after launching its first attacks, the brigade had finally closed up to the river, to find that the Germans had retired behind the blown railway and road bridges.   13 December 1944... The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on Tuesday, 12 December. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish, while the First Division committed the Carleton and York and, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward   15 December 1944... While the Fifth Division pushed across the Naviglio and closed up to the Fosso Munio, the First Division staged a series of local attacks to widen its bridgehead for break-out. During the night of 14-15 December, Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry moved over the canal, with the task of driving the Germans out of ancient, walled Bagnacavallo, where many of the enemy counter-attacks had originated.   20 December 1944... There was no let-up. A determined Charles Foulkes met with his Division commanders within hours after the First Brigades failure on the Fosso Vecchio. New plans were drawn up for yet another joint assault between the First and Fifth Divisions that very night. The object was to force the Germans to abandon the S-shaped Fosso Munio and retire behind the Senio and the task was given to two infantry brigades, the Second and Eleventh, both using two-assault battalions.   2 January 1945... The quiet along the Senio was about to be shattered. At either end of the Canadian sector were pockets of German troops and I Corps headquarters had decided to get rid of them before settling down for the winter. On the right, north of Ravenna, the Germans were huddled behind a web of canals and rivers, below the Lago Comacchio along the line extending from the coast to Alfonsine, where it linked up with the Senio defences.",

    "description":"May 1995 - This set, on the whole, is my personal favorite.  While it's got lots of power, that isn't the reason.  This booster add no new concepts.  Instead, it took the under developed concepts in the game, and expanded to make it playable with inventive powers.  Artifacts were made for many worlds that had few, rule cards had a rarity less than full rares, we found holdings for any world, all champions got better powers, and Dark Sun finally had enough realms to be a viable theme.  This was also the first of two sets that had only 20 chase instead of 25.  However, it was also a set that started using only 1 rare per pack.  Landmark Cards: Wand of Orcus (#1); Obsidian Man of Urik (#14); Rod of 7 Parts (#21-27); Bag of Holding (#28); Temporal Stasis (#53); Deflection (#54); Korgunard the Avangion (#75); Drawmij (#85); Ur Draxa (#91); Anchient Kalidnay (#92); Onad the Weasel (c#6); Young Strahd (c#8); Amulet of Spell Protection (c#17); and the Dragon Font (c#20).",

Now the peace of a century has turned to conflict as the forces of Westlock carve out their own territories for the good of the crown and the glory of Asyra.  In the Mage Wars: Conquest of Kumanjaro - Spell Tome Expansion, players can wage their own matches as a Priest of the Order of Malakai or as a Beastmaster of the Johktari, using new ability cards for each, and a trove of new spells from all the spell schools.  The Johktari Beastmaster is a fierce and proud hunter, defending her people's lands against invaders. She is a skilled archer and has the Ranged +1 trait for all of her non-spell ranged attacks. She can also sprint quickly across the vast savannahs running swift as a Cheetah using her Sprinting ability which gives this Mage the Fast trait. If these abilities weren't deadly enough, the Johktari Beastmaster can use her Wounded Prey ability to mark and relentlessly pursue wounded prey, working with her animals to finish it off.  The Priest of Malakai is a crusader against non-believers. He seeks justice and relentlessly pursues enemies with Holy retribution. The Priest is blessed with the burning light of Malakai, and his basic melee attack deals light damage. In addition, once per round, if the Priest attacks and damages an enemy creature with any attack which deals light damage, the creature may burst into flame via Malakai's Fire. To round out the divine might of this Mage is his Holy Avenger ability.  A few of the creatures in this expansion, such as the Guardian Angel, are ready to defend their Mage at any cost and thus introduce the Intercept ability which allows them to jump in the way of ranged attacks if they are on guard. The set also introduces three new conditions: Bleed, Stuck, and Tainted.",

During setup, three villagers tokens are placed on all village tiles but one. The Moon Portal is placed on the remaining tile (the center tile for normal difficulty, on the side for harder difficulty, in a corner for masochistic players). Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.  Villagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).  Unfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted. Haunters also force villagers to flee (villagers that cannot flee are killed).",

Details on this card: You may remove an Air Force from the board at the beginning of your Supply Step to prevent an unsupplied Army or Navy from being removed this turn.  Game designer notes:  (First FAQ - No, the Air Force does not have to be supplied.) I'd expect to see this rule used about once per game, Can allow for some strategies that have hitherto been a bit to dependent on supply. Can vastly decrease the impact of supply in certain situations.  (Second FAQ - an Air Force can only save one piece; it doesn't put a piece back in supply, to supply other pieces.)

This 85 page hard backed book includes 24 new scenarios which can be played stand-alone or as four complete campaigns.  A campaign is a linked series of between four and six missions where the outcome of each mission affects the overall chance of success in the campaign.

Can they hold out until the relief garrison arrives?  Genestealer Invasion Six linked missions.  The Terminators and Librarians of Septimus V  attempt to destroy a Genestealer patriarch deep inside the body of a crashed Space Hulk.  Necromunda A clever set of six linked missions split into two waves.  The Marine player gets to choose squads of Marines and Librarians from “army lists” and must first contain the Purestrain and Hybrids, then discover and exploit their weakness for total victory.

    "description":"This Age of Steam Expansion expands the game to 1830's Pennsylvania and Northern California.  1830's Pennsylvania: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in 1830’s Pennsylvania, as the industrial revolution began, and the demand for coal to power locomotives and all manner of machinery started to peak. At that time, the railroad industry was driven by an abundant source of coal from the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. Unique features to this map include coal-producing towns and cities in Western Pennsylvania, heavily-urbanized cities in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and special bonuses for coal (black cube) deliveries: coal can be delivered twice as far as your locomotive, or you can receive double income for its delivery!  Northern California: This Age of Steam expansion takes place in Northern California, focusing on San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and Sacramento, and the struggle to move goods across the San Francisco Bay Area. Unique features to this map include two bridges across the San Francisco Bay, the port city of Santa Cruz where goods line up for delivery, a three tile San Jose city with double goods growth, and the ever-changing destination of Sacramento, where the goods desired by that city are dictated by the flow of goods into Santa Cruz. This map is a redesign of the popular Age of Steam: Bay Area map (Essen 2005 Limited Edition), with modified cities and towns, with a map changed slightly in size to fit on a standard Age of Steam board. It is slightly more forgiving than the original map.  From Ted Alspach, the designer of Age of Steam Expansion: Bay Area (Limited 2005 Essen Edition).",

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are \"pie spaces\", and from these there are \"spokes\" of track leading to the middle of the board.  Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.  Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.",

Players have a very clear objective: Eliminate the opponent's champion. Champions start the game in the arena but are inactive and defenseless. They will not fight until the crowd is behind them. Each player takes turns drawing, playing and moving gladiators from their \"hand\" and assisting them with tactic chips.  Based on opponent's moves and play style, each person will need to adjust their strategies. Defend your champ, take over and hold the crowd favor areas, assault opponent's champion, cover deployment zones, eliminate tactictions to reduce enemy options, fight beasts to gain crowd favor, the list of tactical possibilities is endless.  Hoplomachus combines combat, tactics, chip (units) management, level progression (though crowd favor system), team play, player vs board, and so much more.  Blade's Edge: These 10 chips include an all new Champion AND Equipment for each of the 5 Cities that Hoplomachus has to offer. These will be the start of what will be the 'customizable' portion of the game. Champion selection and Equipment option will be determined before each battle begins!  Carpe Venatus!",

Your opponent will have to employ various strategies to attempt to overwhelm your positions. Will he resort to rushing your position with a handful of grenades?

Or will your machine guns pin him down while the artillery you called from your Field Telephone falls on him from overhead.\"  \"Each of the foxholes comes with it's own set of Story Cards, adding new Story Events for each position, and comes with new Order Cards tasking you to Hold your position . A Field Telephone can even be added to a position to call in off board Mortar or Artillery support to help in your defense.\"  \"Each piece comes fully illustrated with easy assembly instructions. All of the terrain is made from the same high quality, sturdy material as your SMG maps so you know that you are receiving a highly durable product that can give you years of enjoyment.\"  Terrain ups the level of game play by introducing new elements of strategy and planning into the game through use of 3D terrain.

Fully compatible with Fairy Meat, Clockwork Stomp is also self-standing game in itself, complete with all the gameplay rules you'll need to load up and march into battle against other wee folk!  Slow, weak, and plodding, gnomes make up for their physical shortcomings with deadly ordnance, sinister gizmos and swift trigger fingers.  With weapons ranging from the simple Iron Pistol to the horrifying Chainkiller Autocannon, these bearded brains are certainly nothing to laugh at!  And with the addition of a mechanical limb or two, even hand-to-hand problems can be overcome- with some small sacrifices...  The gnomes are joined in battle by their mechanical minions, the clockwork fairies.  With a mechanical, propeller-driven body and a living fairy head, the gun-toting clock-fairies provide speedy support for their gnomic masters' field operations.  Rules are also provided for Rogue Clocks, liberated Clockwork Fairies for use in your own Fairy warband!

They display the diversity of terrain in the region, from sandy desert to high mountain peaks, from the marshy lowlands of the Persian Gulf to the rugged, wooded coast of the Caspian Sea, from the wadis of Syria to the karst of Turkey.  Counters cover the armed forces of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt, at standard Europa scales of divisions, brigades, and regiments. Air units represent groupings of 40 to 60 aircraft, organized by type (such as fighters or bombers) and model (from Gladiator biplanes to 4-engined B-24 bombers). Naval units represent individual large warships or flotillas of smaller vessels. The counters also include British and Indian forces which do not appear elsewhere in Europa.  The charts give the orders of battle for the countries of the Near East, and a set of guidelines for combining The Near East with Western Desert (Europa Game VI) is included.

The Morgul Vale is the climactic final Adventure Pack in the \"Against the Shadow\" cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! After exploring underworld locations, encountering hidden ambushes, and rallying the troops during battles and sieges, the new scenario from The Morgul Vale presents Middle-earth's greatest heroes with an opportunity to ride against the strength of Mordor itself. Should they succeed, though, the heroes will find no peace. Instead, they must fend for their lives in battle against one of Mordor's undying captains: the Nazgûl of Minas Morgul!  Meanwhile, while the \"Against the Shadow\" cycle has developed the Gondor trait and strengthened mono-sphere decks, The Morgul Vale draws the cycle's focus on these themes to a close.

Missions are back and therefore so are Tradeships.  Tradeships allow you to perform a mission which may take 1 to 5 turns to complete, during this time the player on a mission will benefit from a Trade Agreement which will give them bonus credits when banking certain resources.  Modifiers are 2x, +5 and 3x the value of the banked resource (according to the Trade Agreement).  This expansion is comprised of 140 cards for 1 to 4 Players.  It also adds 4 white custom dice to be used as counters for Tradeships.  It can add from 15-30 minutes of additional game time to the \"core\" game.

Players will need boards 1-4 of SQUAD LEADER and the ASL rules to play all eight scenarios included herein. However, all other components necessary to play the game are enclosed-absolutely no other purchase is necessary.  PARATROOPER has been specially designed as an Introductory Module for those SQUAD LEADER players contemplating a switch to ASL to provide an inexpensive medium for them to sample the rich delights of the ASL game system without requiring the purchase of the full Russian\/German OB found only in the first ASL Module: BEYOND VALOR. Yet, the countermix in PARATROOPER serves as a supplement to the BEYOND VALOR components, rather than an unneeded duplication of those counters should the player decide to expand his ASL collection.  Included are board 24, featuring a village in a valley, and two countersheets.  Due to the special nature of the fighting that comprised the airborne invasion of Normandy, the eight scenarios emphasize infantry encounters with little in the way of vehicles, ordnance, OBA, or the more detailed rules which constitute the entire spectrum of ASL.  This goes hand-in-hand with the introductory nature of PARATROOPER. PARATROOPER is not a complete game; ownership of ASL and boards 1-4 is required.  Scenario list: 11 Defiance on Hill 30 12 Confusion Reigns 13 Le Manoir 14 Silence that Gun 15 Trapped! 16 No Better Spot to Die 17 Lost Opportunities 18 The Roadblock   The second module for Advanced Squad Leader. This one is an introductory module, geared towards those gamers who are experienced with Squad Leader.  The first edition, published by Avalon Hill, included mapboard 24 and ASL 1st edition rules Chapter K \"Training Manual\". The first four boards from Squad Leader are needed to play the scenarios included.  The second edition, printed by Multiman Publishing, adds mapboards 2 & 4 (from the original Squad Leader) but deletes the Chapter K \"Training Manual\" as it is now included in the ASL 2nd edition rulebook.

These new Monsters were so much fun to have in the other adventures that we decided to expand the monster's world. At the time we didn't want to add new monster figures, we wanted to create new monsters that could still use the same figures. so we created the Hobgoblin, the Ghoul and the Uraki Orc from Lord of the Ring. Another thing that we created was more weapons for the armory and the ability to buy more potions. we took the potions from the treasure cards, the expansions series and a few that we ourselves created, we gave them all a price. and created a new store. This is my favorite story. I hope that you will enjoy playing it as much as we did creating it. Have fun. These games' pdf files are available for downloading.

Players start with a Freight train on each board as well as a Freighter to transport Commodities from one continent to the other.  Trains and Freighters must be in the same Port at the same time to transfer a Commodity, unless a Warehouse is built to store Commodities, ($10 in a Port).  Like the Trains, the Freighter can be upgraded to a Heavy Freighter to increase its load capacity from two Commodities to three.  Freighters take three turns to cross the ocean.  Transatlantic deliveries pay double.  This variant is included in Train Gamers Gazette 2(1).  Warehouses, Freighters and Port cards need to be photocopied onto cardstock and cut out before playing.",
